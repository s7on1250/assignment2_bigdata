Chicago Tribune archives, 15 June 1958, page 90 The Production Code Administration only authorized the film after substantial changes to the novel's story line.

She was right in saying that that was not her book."Michelangelo Capua, Jean Negulesco: The Life and Films, McFarland 2017, p.107 ==Awards and nominations== Award Category Nominee(s) Result Academy Awards Best Art Direction Art Direction: Lyle R.
