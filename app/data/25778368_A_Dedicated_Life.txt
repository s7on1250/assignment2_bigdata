is a 1994 Japanese documentary and docudrama film directed by Kazuo Hara about writer Mitsuharu Inoue. It shows the last four years of Inoue's life while fighting cancer, and tries to capture his character and the influence he had on the people around him. ==Synopsis== Filming Inoue both at public appearances and in private, and interviewing fellow writers like Yutaka Haniya as well as former pupils of Inoue's literary training centers, some of which speak frankly about their affair with their married teacher, Kazuo Hara draws a portrait of a multi-faceted personality: socially committed and egotistical, extroverted and hiding behind a persona. Additionally, the film contains scenes which re-enact Inoue's childhood and youth according to his own accounts, which are partially put into question by statements from relatives. ==Cast== * Mitsuharu Inoue * Yutaka Haniya * Jakuchō Setouchi * Hiroshi Noma * Ikuko Inoue * Kim Gumija as Mother Takako * Yoshie Yamamoto as Grandmother Saka * Haruhi Iso as Choi Tsuruyo * Masayuki Kubota as Mitsuharu as youth * Hiroya Sugiyama as Mitsuharu as child ==Production== Early into the film's production, Inoue was diagnosed with liver metastasis, underwent an operation (which is shown in detail) and continued his work as a writer and teacher.
