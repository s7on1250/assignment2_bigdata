Metacritic gives the film a score of 38 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Andy Webster of The New York Times states in his review, "While this unrelentingly midtempo movie milks Brooklyn for its chic, it manages to denude it of its color. A moment of dramatic anger from Sam feels forced and abrupt, while — surprise — the climax involves a dash to a joyous reunion. The filmmakers sought the rights to Joni Mitchell's classic song 'A Case of You'; to her credit, she wouldn't hand them over, perhaps because the tune is imbued with deep, honest feelings." Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, "A lot of interesting, funny performers aren't very interesting or funny [...] this surprisingly bland indie version of the generic mainstream romantic comedy has talent to burn, none of it put to good use. It’s not awful, but the paucity of fresh ideas or humor makes this overly safe first writing effort for all three scribes innocuous to the point of instant forgettability." ==Release== A Case of You premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival and was released by IFC Films on video on demand platforms as well as in a limited theatrical release on November 8, 2013. It was released on DVD on February 4, 2014. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 romantic comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Kat Coiro Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:IFC Films films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films Category:English-language romantic comedy films
