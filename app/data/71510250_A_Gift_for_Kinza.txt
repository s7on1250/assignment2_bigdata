Hibbard, 1993 p. 67: "The Time of Friendship contains three fable-like short stories, all of which address issues involving deception, justice and Islam." ==Plot== Ali resides with his older brother, the proprietor of a cafe (with accent) in Morocco. The younger brother is disaffected and resents his obligation to assist his elder sibling in the operation of the establishment as required by primogeniture. Ali also objects to his brother's indulgence in alcohol, a violation of Islamic strictures, as well as his courting of a local girl, Kinza, who the brother hopes to seduce. A Belgian tourist seeking shelter from a rainstorm at the café shares beers with the elder proprietor. The visitor possesses a prescription of powerful sleeping pills. He gladly provides the elder brother with enough of the sedative to immobilize a person. Ali overhears the transaction. The older brother returns to the cafe the next day after visiting Kinza. Ali notes his agitation. The following day police arrive and interrogate the brother. He admits that he did not understand the deadly risks associated with the soporific he had furtively administered to the young women. He is arrested for murder of Kinza. Ali dispassionately recognizes that he will soon come into possession of the café.Hibbard, 1993 p. 67 ==Theme== Literary critic John Ditsky writes: == Footnotes == == Sources == * Bowles, Paul. 2001.
