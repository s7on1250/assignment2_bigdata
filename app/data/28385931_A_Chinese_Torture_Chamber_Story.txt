A Chinese Torture Chamber Story is a 1994 Hong Kong erotic (Category III) black comedy film produced by Wong Jing and directed by Bosco Lam. ==Plot== Siu-bak-choi (lit. "Little Cabbage") is a female servant of the physician Yeung Nai-mou. Yeung is open towards the topic of sex, which is usually considered taboo in traditional Chinese society. He invents a type of condom to help people avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases, but his idea was not accepted and he was scorned at. Lau Hoi-sing, the lecherous son of a local judge, has an adulterous affair with Yeung's wife, but they are discovered by Little Cabbage. Yeung's wife tries to send Little Cabbage away by forcing the latter to marry Gok Siu-dai so as to prevent Little Cabbage from telling Yeung about her secret affair. Lau has been eyeing Little Cabbage for some time and he rapes her, but is discovered by Gok. Yeung's wife is afraid of being implicated so she instigates Lau to murder Gok and frame Yeung and Little Cabbage for the deed. The pair are put on trial and subjected to tortures to force them to "confess" to the crime. ==Cast== * Yvonne Yung as Siu-bak-choi (Little Cabbage) * Lawrence Ng as Yeung Nai-mou * Tommy Wong as Gok Siu-dai * Ching Mai as Jane, Yeung's wife * Oh Yin-hei as Yeung's sister * Kenny Wong as Lau Hoi-sing * Elvis Tsui as Win Chung-lung * Kingdom Yuen as Nanny * Julie Lee as Ki Dan-fung * Lo Hung as Judge Lau, Hoi Sing's father * Lee Siu-kei as Judge of Supreme Court * Liu Fan as Prison guard * Dave Lam as Court assistant * Leung Sai-on * Leung Kei-hei * Aman Chang ==External links== * * Category:1994 films Category:1990s Cantonese-language films Category:Films set in 19th-century Qing dynasty Category:Hong Kong sex comedy films Category:Discotek Media Category:Films about rape Category:1990s sex comedy films Category:1994 comedy films Category:1990s Hong Kong films
