A comedy with a spice of drama about two young men who live in the country but decide to move to the big city. All the travel turns into a reason for consideration and giving a new meaning to their past and future life. Do they finally arrive in the big city or come back to their village? ==Plot== Evtim (Popandov) and Pesho (Mavrodiev), two young men, decided to leave their native village and move to the big city. They bring with them big stuff from the home household goods but also their good intentions and uncertainty. Both of them carry some remorses too. Evtim because of the scandal with his older brother and Pesho because of leaving the home with not a notice to his parents. Standing by the road, amid a heap of luggage, they turned to be a colorful view as hitch- hikers to the passing vehicles. But so, the two friends have an opportunity to meet the variety of life. They see generous sympathy but also the selfishness; they see the exciting waves of the true love but also the repulsive duplicity. This meetings, in its own way, form their realization about the substantial milestones in the path of life. ==Production== Production company: *Studio of Featured Films (SFF) - a Film Unit SREDETS Working title: The Three Whishes Bulgarian National Film Archive, Bulgarian Featured Film Encyclopedy 2008, volume three, p. 216 *Director:Georgi K.
