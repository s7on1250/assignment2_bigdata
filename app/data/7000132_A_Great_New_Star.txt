A Great New Star is a 1952 musical sponsored film starring Dinah Shore, with her singing "See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet" (at the time, she starred in a twice-weekly 15-minute musical interlude for Chevrolet on NBC-TV). It starts off with her singing "It's a Most Unusual Day", and then shows an ephemeral film being made. The ending has her singing the Chevrolet jingle with shots of Chevrolet cars and America. It was made by the Jam Handy Organization. ==External links== *A Great New Star at archive.org Category:1952 films Category:Sponsored films Category:Chevrolet Category:1952 musical films Category:Jam Handy Organization films Category:Promotional films Category:1950s English-language films Category:American musical films Category:American short films Category:1950s American films
