A Couple of Hamburgers is a 1935 short story by James Thurber, the American writer, considered to be one of his best. It is a thumbnail sketch of a couple in a dysfunctional marriage. It has been suggested that while The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, arguably Thurber's best-known short story, is a comical story with a tragic side, this is a tragic story with a comical side. ==References== Category:1935 short stories Category:Works by James Thurber Category:Works originally published in The New Yorker
