Shirley Horn Discography, accessed July 25, 2017 ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Ken Dryden called it "a fine studio set" additionally commenting: "An always effective vocalist who provided her own top-notch accompaniment on piano, Horn's almost conversational style of singing works very well whether she is swinging an oldie like 'I'm Old Fashioned' or delivering a lush, infectious interpretation of a ballad like 'A Lazy Afternoon'." ==Track listing== # "I'm Old Fashioned" (Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer) – 2:43 # "There's No You" (Hal Hopper, Tom Adair) – 6:14 # "New York's My Home" (Gordon Jenkins) – 2:46 # "Why Did I Choose You?"
