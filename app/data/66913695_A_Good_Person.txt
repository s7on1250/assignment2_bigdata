The day following a family party, Allison causes an accident while driving with her eyes off the road, killing her future brother and sister-in-law Jesse & Molly, and sustaining critical injuries. One year later, dealing with severe depression and unable to deal with her guilt, Allison lives with her mother Diane, who attempts to curb her daughter's addiction to pain pills. Meanwhile, Nathan and Molly's ex-cop father Daniel is taking care of his granddaughter Ryan, who is still processing the loss of her mother. After failing to get drugs illicitly from her friend Becka, and after a humiliating encounter with two high school acquaintances leads her into a downward spiral, Allison joins a therapy group. There, she unexpectedly encounters Daniel, who reveals in a meeting that his drinking resulted in repeated blackouts where he wouldn't remember his violent behavior, and that in one such occasion he destroyed the hearing in Nathan's ear. Ryan, in her turn, is bullied for her status as an orphan and in trouble for her behavior. Allison meets Daniel at his house, and while leaving, she is confronted by Ryan for Allison's direct responsibility in her mother's death. Allison eventually relapses, before pulling herself together and accompanying Ryan to a concert, where Allison is reintroduced to Nathan and his new paralegal girlfriend. Allison is devastated at what she perceives as a cruel act by Ryan, and accompanies her to an after-party where she relapses again. Allison is unable to protect Ryan being taken advantage of in a back room, but Daniel arrives and puts an end to it. Outside, he confesses that he considered Allison a test from God, but now realizes she's a waste. After accepting her role in the accident, Allison is able to move toward recovery. A year later, Allison is writing songs, and she and Nathan reacquaint themselves. Daniel passes on suddenly, leaving Ryan in Nathan's care until she leaves for college, and Allison attends the funeral where she discovers Daniel's letter to her explaining his thoughts and that the Latin translation of his tattoo "amor fati" is "to love one's fate". ==Cast== Other appearances include Drew Gehling as Max, Jessie Mueller as Sandra Keen, Shirley Rumierk as Dr. Gonzalez, Cary Brothers as himself, Charlene Kaye as bassist, and Jackie Hoffman as Belinda. ==Production== On February 26, 2021, it was reported Zach Braff would write and direct A Good Person, a drama starring Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman.
