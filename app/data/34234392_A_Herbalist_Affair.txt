His enthusiasm attracts his colleague Sin-Yu, who does not want to work under her rich father. Yee-Fai is very careful with Sin-Yu as he thinks that she has been appointed to investigate him. Yee-Fai goes to Shanghai on business, and while there, he looks for an old friend of Si-Sung’s. Sin-Yu goes along with him as his secretary, and volunteers to help him fulfil his grandfather’s wish. Later, Yee-Fai meets Chinese medicine practitioner Geung Sum-Yu and Gook Yut-Siu. As Yee-Fai gets to know Yut-Siu better, they eventually work together in the medicine business. ==Cast== ===The Cheung family=== Cast Role Description Roger Kwok Cheung Yee Fai 張二輝 Cheung See Sang's grandson Cheung Wai On's son Cheung Tai San's younger brother Kuk Yat Siu's older hal-brother Ng Sin Yu's ex-boyfriend Keung Sam Yuet's boyfriend Ada Mui (梅素芳) Liu Siu Man 廖子敏 Cheung See Sang's granddaughter in-law Cheung Wai On's daughter in-law Cheung Tai San's sister in-law Bowie Wu Cheung See Sang 張時生 Cheung Wai On's father Cheung Tai San, Cheung Yee Fai and Kuk Yat Siu's grandfather Eddy Ko Cheung Wai On 張懷安 Cheung See Sang's son Cheung Tai San, Cheung Yee Fai and Kuk Yat Siu's father Shirley Yim (雪梨) Cheung Tai San 張大珊 Cheung See Sang's granddaughter Cheung Wai On's daughter Cheung Yee Fai's older sister Kuk Yat Siu's older half-sister ===The Ng family=== Cast Role Description Charmaine Sheh Ng Sin Yu (Ruby) 吳倩如 Ng Sing's daughter Cheung Yee Fai's ex-girlfriend Chung Ching Lung's ex-wife Yu Yeung (于洋) Ng Sing 吳星 Ng Sin Yu's father Henry Lo (魯振順) Hong Chai 康齊 ===The Keung family=== Cast Role Description Melissa Ng Keung Sam Yuet 姜心悅 Keung Tit To's daughter Ng Sin Yu's good friend Ma Tat's ex-girlfriend Cheung Yee Fai's girlfriend Wong Wai (王偉) Keung Tit To 姜鐵圖 Keung Sam Yuet's father Kuk Lai Sa's good friend ===The Kuk family=== Cast Role Description Angelina Lo (盧宛茵) Kuk Lai Sa 谷麗莎 Cheung Wai On's lover Kuk Yat Siu's mother Fong Kau's mother in-law Keung Tit To's good friend Derek Lee (李浩林) Kuk Yat Siu 谷一宵 Kuk Lai Sa and Cheung Wai On's son Cheung See Sang's grandson Cheung Tai San and Cheung Yee Fai's younger brother in-law Fong Kau's husband Eileen Yeow Fong Kau 房姣 Kuk Lai Sa and Cheung See Sang's daughter in-law Kuk Yat Siu's wife ===Other cast=== Cast Role Description Power Chan Chow Chi Wah 周志華 Cheung Yee Fai's good friend Mark Kwok Chung Ching Lung 鍾正龍 Ng Sin Yu's ex-husband Ku Feng Tam Kwong Cheung 譚廣昌 Kuk Yat Siu's La mian teacher Kwok Man Lung (郭文龍) Ma Tat 馬達 Keung Sam Yuet's ex-boyfriend ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:TVB dramas Category:2002 Hong Kong television series debuts Category:2002 Hong Kong television series endings Category:2003 Hong Kong television series debuts Category:2003 Hong Kong television series endings Category:Serial drama television series Category:Hong Kong romance television series Category:2000s romance television series Category:2000s Hong Kong television series
