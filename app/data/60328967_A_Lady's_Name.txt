She needs ideas for her new book. She hatches a plan where she will advertise for a husband and see if the candidates provide the literary inspiration she needs. Gerald is a "stuffed Shirt" who angrily objects to her plan. She proceeds anyway. It is decided that Mabel's roommate, Maud Bray (Vera Doria), will screen all responders and frighten away the less desirable suitors. This allows Mabel to respond to the more interesting letters. Shortly Mabel becomes embroiled in a number of adventures. One of her applicants is a butler. He is employed by Noel Corcoran (Harrison Ford). As it turns out, Noel has also answered the ad. Noel informs Mabel that Gerald has bet the other members of his club that she will stop answering letters. Mabel is furious. She starts responding to several particularly lurid letters.
