A Corazón Abierto (English: Open Heart) is the eleventh studio album by Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández. Released on September 7, 2004 via Columbia Records, it was produced by Kike Santander and Áureo Baqueiro. The album is often regarded as Fernández's debut into contemporary pop, straying away from his previous roots in mariachi and ranchera music. The first single, "Me Dediqué a Perderte" sold over 63,000 digital downloads in Mexico. == Reception == The album garnered mainly positive reception. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic described the album as a "batch of well-crafted songs", further stating, "relative to his previous pop albums, though, Fernández sounds more at ease on A Corazón Abierto, as if he's truly enjoying himself and singing from the heart. That he sounds more at home makes A Corazón Abierto perhaps his best pop album to date". ==Track listing== ===CD=== Source: Official Website ===DVD=== # Me Dediqué A Perderte (Video) # Alejandro – De Gira # Cronología # Lucharé Por Tu Amor (Video) ==Personnel== *Pablo Alfaro – photography *Esteban Aristizabal – vocal engineer *Pablo Arraya – engineer, vocal engineer *Aureo Baqueiro – percussion, arranger, keyboards, programming, producer, engineer, fender rhodes, vocal arrangement, string arrangements, art direction, direction, A&R; *Daniel Betancourt – arranger, keyboards, programming, producer *Gustavo Borner – mixing, string engineer *Richard Bravo – percussion *Rodrigo Cárdenas – bass *Jason Carder – trumpet *Luis Angel Cortez – assistant *Mike Couzzi – string engineer *Ian Cuttler – art direction, design *Pepe Damián – drums *Fernando de Santiago – vihuela *Beto Dominguez – percussion *Vicky Echeverri – chorus *Paul Forat – art direction, A&R; *Luis Gil – drum engineering *Manny López – acoustic guitar *Bill Meyers – string arrangements *Miami Symphonic Strings – strings *Boris Milan – mixing *Sergio Minski – production coordination *José Antonio Molina – string arrangements *Marco Moreno – assistant, pro-tools *Novi Novag – viola, string arrangements *Alfredo Oliva – concert comedian *Daniel Ortega – electric guitar *Wendy Pederson – chorus *Richie Perez – engineer *Pancho Ruiz – electric bass *Milton Salcedo – piano, arranger, keyboards, programming, producer, fender rhodes, wind arrangements *Freddie Sandoval – engineer *Kike Santander – acoustic guitar, arranger, producer, Spanish guitar, wind arrangements *Marco Antonio Santiago – guitarron *Dana Teboe – trumpet *Ramiro Teran – chorus, engineer *Don C.
