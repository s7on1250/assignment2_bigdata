Although generally playing alto, Fortune is also heard on soprano and flute ... While not one of Fortune's most essential releases (one wishes that he had played some tenor too), A Better Understanding has enough variety and surprises to make it recommended". On All About Jazz, Florence Wetzell noted "A Better Understanding, features nine Fortune originals and is an embarrassment of riches, with one excellent song after another and top-notch accompaniment".Wetzel, F.
