A Dog of Flanders is a 1960 American drama film directed by James B. Clark, with stars David Ladd, Donald Crisp and Theodore Bikel. It is based on the 1872 novel of the same name by Ouida. It was released on March 17, 1960, by 20th Century Fox in CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe. Unlike the novel, which has a tragic end, the film has a happy ending for the boy and his dog. Spike (who played Old Yeller in the 1959 Disney Film) plays Patrasche in 20th Century Fox's A Dog of Flanders with Donald Crisp and David Ladd in 1959. ==Plot== The emotional story of a boy, his grandfather, and his dog.

Lippert enjoyed success with a children's film starring David Ladd called The Sad Horse. The film was announced in March 1959. Robert L. Lippert says the film was originally shot in black and white "but everything was so beautiful so we changed it to color." Filming started June 22, 1959. The film was shot in Holland and Belgium. It included a 12-minute scene where Theodore Bikel gives a painting lesson. "Everybody thought they were crazy when he did that", said producer Radnitz. "But the kids loved it." ==Comic book adaptation== * Dell Four Color #1088 (April 1960) ==Reception== The film was one of Lippert's most successful films, commercially making over $3 million. Hedda Hopper called it "the sleeper of the year." Lippert bought a story, Gallus to make as a follow up for Clark and Ladd. However the film was not made. They ended up making Misty. Writer Ted Sherdeman and director Clark later formed their own company, Gemtaur. The film was first in the children's film category at the Venice Film Festival. ==See also== * List of American films of 1960 ==References== ==External links== * * *Dog of Flanders at BFI * * *A Dog of Flanders at TV Guide (a revised and expanded version of 1987 write-up which was originally published in The Motion Picture Guide) Category:1960 films Category:Films based on works by Ouida Category:Films shot in Antwerp Category:1960 drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:CinemaScope films Category:American drama films Category:Films adapted into comics Category:Films about dogs Category:Films directed by James B.
