"A Beat for You" is a song by Australian pop group Pseudo Echo. The song was released in April 1984 as the second single from their debut studio album, Autumnal Park (1984). The song peaked at number 12 on the Australian Kent Music Report. A slightly updated version of the song appeared as the leadoff track on the North American release of the group's follow-up album, Love an Adventure. Referring to this version, AllMusic said, "driving hard rock riffs puncture Pierre Gigliotti and James Leigh's wall of synthesizers. Vocalist Brian Canham has a darkly erotic voice that only new wave groups seem to breed -- imagine a cross between Jim Kerr of Simple Minds and Midge Ure." == Track listing == 7" (EMI-1252) *Side A "A Beat for You" – 3:43 *Side B "Autumnal Park" – 4:10 12" (EMI – ED 81) *Side A "A Beat for You" (extended) – 7:36 *Side B "Autumnal Park" – 4:10 *Side B "A Beat for You" (single) – 3:43 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1984) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 12 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1984) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 70 New Zealand (RIANZ) 36 == References == Category:1982 songs Category:1984 singles Category:Pseudo Echo songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Punter
