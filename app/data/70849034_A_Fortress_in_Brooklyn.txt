thumb|right 5A Fortress in Brooklyn: Race, Real Estate, and the Making of Hasidic Williamsburg is a nonfiction book by Jewish studies professor Nathaniel Deutsch and historian Michael Casper, published by Yale University Press in May, 2021. It has been favorably reviewed in NYBooks, The Jewish News of Northern California, and The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles. == Contents == The 391-page book minutiously chronicles the history of the Yiddish speaking community of Williamsburg (Brooklyn, NY): its stringent inception in the post World War II years by a wave of Hasidic Jew immigration originated from Eastern European shtetls, its contentious relations with neighboring African American and Puerto Rican communities, and its partly reluctant but progressive gentrification by the forces of commerce and urban development. The narrative covers historic, racial, sociological, political, urbanistic, and emotional aspects. == Critique == Critics from various sources encounter the book "persuasive" (Samuel Stein, Jewish Currents, 2021). "fascinating" (Zalman Newfield, New Books Network), or "delightful, compelling, interesting" (Bennet Baumer, The Indypendent). Ben Rothke (The Times of Israel) praised its "spellbinding narrative", while Gabe S. Tennen (Gothan Center) referred to the book as "detailed, crisply written, a caveat to nearly fifty years of scholarship". == Awards == The book won the 71st National Jewish Book Awards in American Jewish Studies (2022) given by the Jewish Book Council, in recognition to the "impressive training, sensitivity and scholarly style" distinguishing the authors. == References == Category:2021 non-fiction books Category:English non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books about New York City Category:Books about Jews and Judaism Category:Books about urbanism Category:Hasidic Judaism in New York City Category:Jews and Judaism in Brooklyn Category:History books about the United States Category:Yale University Press books Category:Historical novelists by nationality Category:Yiddish culture in New York City
