Los Angeles: Epitaph Records. 2008. 86938-2. Like their previous album Decomposer, A Band in Hope features multiple producers, though fewer this time around. According to frontman Shawn Harris' blog, the album was created in a period of despair due to the record sales of Decomposer. Instead of following up with the sister album titled The Mad Silentist, the band scrapped many of the old songs (only four remain in the final cut) and re-wrote the album. The new album, as Harris states, sways between hope and despair, and the hope one gets when they feel disillusioned and abandoned. ==Release information== On March 11, 2008, the Matches released the entire album on their MySpace page, and were featured on the MySpace front page. The next day the video for the first single "Wake the Sun" was released exclusively on Yahoo! Music. The video for "Yankee in a Chip Shop" was supposed to debut on MySpace Music on August 29, 2008. However, due to issues with the London Metropolitan Police that singer/guitarist Shawn Harris detailed in a blog post, including police that Harris were "rent-a- cops" who took the band members' names and had CCTV tapes of the band "running down the middle of the huge roundabout at Piccadilly Circus that was the video's finale", the video was removed shortly after its posting. (The issue was later resolved and the video released.) ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart performance for A Band in Hope Chart (2008) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 99 ==References== Category:The Matches albums Category:2008 albums Category:Epitaph Records albums
