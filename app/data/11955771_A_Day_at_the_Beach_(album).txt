A Day at the Beach is the second album by the Chicago-based rock, soul, and rhythm and blues group Sonia Dada, released in 1995. It was produced by the band. ==Critical reception== The Philadelphia Daily News wrote that Sonia Dada "serves up rock, gospel, doo-wop, soul and R&B; ... This means either they're eclectic, or they're groping." The Indianapolis Star deemed the album "a frothy arena-band sound with simply nice vocals, something you might get by mixing Toto and the Little River Band." ==Track listing== Sources: Official Site, AllMusic ==References== Category:1995 albums Category:Capricorn Records albums Category:Sonia Dada albums
