He lives a comfortable and materialistic life due to the wealthy clients he treats, but is nevertheless discontented with his life and acts coldly to those around him. His life is thrown into disarray, however, when he is visited by the ghost of his ex-wife Anna Paul (Jennifer Ehle), who was recently killed in a car accident. Anna asks Michael to help keep running the free clinic she previously directed, which leads Michael to be exposed to poorer patients in need who are far different from his usual clientele. Michael's sister Christina (Julie Benz), a single mother struggling to care for her troubled teenaged son Milo (Liam Aiken), believes in the supernatural and is thrilled with the idea that Anna is back in Michael's life, as she insists he was a better person when she was around. ==Cast and characters== ===Main cast=== * Patrick Wilson as Dr. Michael Holt, a brilliant neurosurgeon and owner of Holt Neuro.

The show was given a 65 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the show three stars out of five, saying "The cast here nails their roles, from Wilson down to support players like Emmy winner Margo Martindale as his loyal assistant, Rita. Ehle has a much trickier role and handles it well. It’s a show that wants to say something. Now it needs viewers who want to listen." Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said "with just a few tiny modifications, A Gifted Man could be a smart satiric comedy, but I don’t think that is what Grant is shooting for," poking fun at Julie Benz's character's cosmic beliefs and dysfunctional family. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe compared the show to Grey's Anatomy, saying "[the show] needs to transcend that limited and overused construct, and set the characters free from endless debate over whether Anna is real or not. Let the actors find drama in more earthly concerns. I think they’re up to it." Robert Bianco of USA Today says "Wilson has the magnetism and acting chops to lead a network series. [Gifted Man] could not have been given better actors. It needs to give them better in return." Phil Dyess-Nugent and Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the pilot a B rating. ===Ratings=== Season Timeslot Season premiere Season finale TV Season Ranking Viewers (in millions) 1 Friday 8 p.m. (September 23, 2011 – February 10, 2012) Friday 9 p.m. (February 17, 2012 – March 2, 2012) September 23, 2011 March 2, 2012 2011–2012 #60 8.63 == See also == * List of ghost films * Saving Hope ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s American workplace drama television series Category:2011 American television series debuts Category:2012 American television series endings Category:Ghosts in television Category:CBS original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:American fantasy television series Category:2010s American medical television series Category:Television series by CBS Studios Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television shows filmed in New York (state) Category:American fantasy drama television series
