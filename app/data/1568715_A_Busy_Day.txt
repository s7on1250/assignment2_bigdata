On her way to attack the couple, the wife interrupts the set of a film, knocking over a film director and a police officer. Finally, the husband pushes the wife off a pier and she falls into the harbor. ==Notes== According to the 1965 book The Films of Charlie Chaplin, A Busy Day is the first of three films in which Chaplin plays a woman. The other two were The Masquerader (1914) and A Woman (1915). Chaplin used the wardrobe of fellow Keystone player Alice Davenport. It was typical for Mack Sennett to shoot Keystone comedies using real events—such as a parade—as the background for comic mayhem. This short film (about half a reel) was shot near San Pedro Harbor in less than two hours. In it, one can see interesting glimpses of First World War-era American naval ships in the background. The other part of the reel is an educational short titled The Morning Papers. ==Review== A reviewer from Bioscope noted, "[Chaplin] gives an amazing exhibition of acrobatic humor." ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin as Wife * Mack Swain as Husband * Phyllis Allen as The Other Woman * Mack Sennett as Film director * Billy Gilbert as Police officer * Ted Edwards as Police officer ==External links== * * * * Category:1914 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:1914 comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:Silent American comedy films Category:Keystone Studios films Category:Films produced by Mack Sennett Category:1914 short films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:American comedy short films Category:Mutual Film films Category:1910s English-language films Category:1910s American films
