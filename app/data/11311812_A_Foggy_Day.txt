"A Foggy Day" is a popular song composed by George Gershwin, with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. The song was introduced by Fred Astaire in the 1937 film A Damsel in Distress. It was originally titled "A Foggy Day (In London Town)" in reference to the pollution-induced pea soup fogs that were common in London during that period, and is often still referred to by the full title. The commercial recording by Astaire for Brunswick was very popular in 1937. ==Other recordings== * Frank Sinatra – Songs for Young Lovers (1953) *Ella Fitzgerald on her Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Song Book from Verve Records, 1959. * Charles Mingus – Pithecanthropus Erectus (1956) * Louis Armstrong with Ella Fitzgerald – Ella and Louis (1956) * Billie Holiday – Songs for Distingué Lovers (1957) * Red Garland – Red Garland at the Prelude (1959) * Frank Sinatra — Ring-a-Ding-Ding!
