In the summer of 2018, Robin Thede invited her close friends and fellow comedians Quinta Brunson, Ashley Nicole Black, and Gabrielle Dennis to help her develop a comedy series. Thede then pitched the series to HBO as a way to address the dearth of Black women's representation in the American comedic landscape. Thede was encouraged by HBO executives to push boundaries and take risks with the show. The show was originally titled The Black Lady Sketch Show but the name was changed to communicate to audiences that the series is a single representation of Black women in comedy. The show is thought to be the first sketch comedy series written, produced by, and starring Black women. On January 28, 2019, it was announced that HBO had ordered a half-hour sketch show, A Black Lady Sketch Show, written and created by Robin Thede. Issa Rae is the co-executive producer with Thede through Issa Rae Productions, known as Hoorae as of 2021. The season one director is Dime Davis. Season two was directed by Lacey Duke and Brittany Scott Smith. Bridget Murphy Stokes is the third season's director. On August 27, 2019, HBO announced that A Black Lady Sketch Show had been renewed for a second season. Filming of the second season was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but on March 23, 2021 it was announced that the six-episode season would premiere on April 23, 2021. On May 24, 2021, HBO renewed the series for a third season. On June 2, 2022, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season. === Casting === thumb|200px|alt=Official season 4 promotional poster shows the cast members in various costumes, Photoshopped together in a room with high ceilings and wooden walls.|Official season 4 promotional poster.

In a review by Ali Barthwell for The A.V. Club, she wrote, "A Black Lady Sketch Show possesses a confidence in its first season that suggests the show is not interested in being chopped up into easily consumable chunks. A Black Lady Sketch Show seems more interested in creating a whimsical, loving world for its leads." Writing for Vulture, Jen Chaney stated: "A Black Lady Sketch Show isn’t just funny. Its sketches are consistently clever and surprising, often concluding with twist endings that add a whole other layer to the jokes that had us rolling a couple of minutes ago." In 2020, the show became the first Black women-led sketch show to receive a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series. === Season two === The second season also received positive reception. It holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on eight critics' reviews. IndieWire journalist Kristen Lopez said that the season "once again delivers hilarity and absurdity in equal measure." Margaret Lyons of the New York Times wrote that the show "has such a fun ear for specifics and lyricism, and the new season grows seamlessly into itself; the show’s recurring characters are back, and Robin Thede, its star and creator, is as dynamic as ever." Danette Chavez of The A.V. Club noted the show "has an air of reinvention" and "retains the cohesion, rapid-fire energy, and mix of culturally specific and universal humor that made the first season uproarious and a joy to watch." The second season received five Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Variety Sketch Series and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Sketch Series. Daysha Broadway, Stephanie Filo, and Jessica Hernández received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Picture Editing for Variety Programming, the first all-women of color ensemble to receive the award in Emmy history. Season two was named to "best" year-end lists published by Paste, The A.V. Club, The Root, and NPR. === Season three === The season holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on six critics' reviews. Kristen Baldwin of EW rated the season an A− and hailed it as "consistently, ridiculously funny." Similarly, The A.V. Club's Jenna Scherer described the show: "In its third season, A Black Lady Sketch Show continues to blaze a trail as a show both by and for its titular demographic, unafraid to make cultural references that will gleefully whizz over the heads of white viewers." Scherer also complimented the chemistry of the cast members: "they share such an easy rapport, riffing off each other seemingly effortlessly whether the moment is scripted or improvised." == Awards and nominations == Award Year Category Nominee Result American Cinema Editors Awards 2022 Best Edited Variety Talk/Sketch Show or Special Daysha Broadway, Stephanie Filo, and Jessica Hernández (for "Sister, May I Call You Oshun?")
