The A Bailar Tour was the first headlining concert tour by Argentine recording artist Lali in support of her debut studio album, A Bailar (2014). The tour began on April 19, 2014, in Buenos Aires and concluded in on April 25, 2016, Tel Aviv. It was the highest-grossing tour of 2015 in Argentina. ==Background== On September 2, 2013, Espósito had launched her solo career in an show at La Trastienda. The same night, she performed "A Bailar", "Asesina" and "Del Otro Lado". On March 15, 2014, a few days before the album release, Espósito performed "A Bailar" at the Caserta Festival in Italy. The first leg of the tour included shows in Argentina, Uruguay, Spain and Italy. On November 27, Espósito performed as the opening act for a Ricky Martin's show at Ciudad del Rock, Buenos Aires in front of more than eighty thousand people. The five shows at the Opera Allianz Theater grossed AR$ 2,500,000. The second leg of the tour consisted in five summer shows and performances in festivals. The dates for the third leg of the tour were announced on March 4, 2015, via Espósito's official Twitter account. Most of the dates included cities that had been previously visited in the first leg. Because of the high ticket demand for the shows in Rosario and Salta, a second date in each city was added. The fourth and last leg of the tour included dates in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Israel. On October 3, 2015, Espósito performed as the opening act for Katy Perry's The Prismatic World Tour show at Hipódromo de Palermo in Buenos Aires. This leg of the tour included two sold out dates at the Luna Park Arena in Buenos Aires and two at the Menora Mivtachim Arena in Tel Aviv. ==Set lists== ==Shows== List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, opening acts, tickets sold, number of available tickets and amount of gross revenue Date City Country Venue Opening acts Attendance Revenue South AmericaSouth American dates (first leg): * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * April 19, 2014 Buenos Aires Argentina Teatro Opera Allianz rowspan="24" 5,000 / 5,000 $2,500,000 April 20, 2014 May 3, 2014 Mar del Plata Radio City rowspan="6" May 4, 2014 Olavarria Teatro Municipal 500 / 500 May 17, 2014 Bahía Blanca Teatro Don Bosco rowspan="4" May 23, 2014 Rosario Auditorio Fundación Astengo May 24, 2014 Santa Fe Teatro ATE Casa España May 31, 2014 Córdoba Quality Espacio July 8, 2014 Buenos Aires Teatro Opera Allianz 7,500 / 7,500 July 9, 2014 July 21, 2014 August 29, 2014 La Plata Coliseo Podestá rowspan="2" rowspan="13" September 19, 2014 Centro Cultural Dardo Rocha October 18, 2014 Montevideo Uruguay Teatro de Verano 4,218 / 4,218 October 24, 2014 Ituzaingó Argentina Teatro Gran Ituzaingó rowspan="2" October 25, 2014 Avellaneda Teatro Colonial October 26, 2014 Buenos Aires Ciudad del Rock 60,000 / 60,000 November 26, 2014 La Trastienda Club rowspan="7" November 27, 2014 November 30, 2014 Mendoza Auditorio Ángel Bustelo December 1, 2014 San Juan Teatro Sarmiento December 4, 2014 Catamarca Cine Teatro Catamarca December 5, 2014 Santiago del Estero Teatro 25 de Mayo December 6, 2014 Tucumán Teatro Mercedes Sosa EuropeEuropean box score: * * December 13, 2014 Madrid Spain Teatro Goya rowspan="2" 520 / 520 rowspan="2" December 15, 2014 Rome Italy Duepuntozero 847 / 847 South AmericaSouth American box score (second leg): * South American box score (third leg): * * *South American box score (fourth leg): * * * * * January 16, 2015 Buenos Aires Argentina F.
