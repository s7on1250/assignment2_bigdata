His research assistant, Delia, blackmails him into a promise of marriage, but he remains attached to his wife, and poisons Delia. When the police arrive at his home to question him, he flees in his car but fatally crashes it as a result of smoking a poisoned cigarette that his wife has unknowingly brought from his laboratory. ==Reception== In a 2017 study of Bryanston Films, Duncan Petrie writes that the film did not make "any impact either commercially or critically" When the film was released in the US (under the title They All Died Laughing), The New York Times called it "nonconformist but not especially sidesplitting" although having "a deftly casual air about it as well as the polish of professionalism"."Comedy at the Coronet", The New York Times, 16 March 1964 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1964 films Category:1964 comedy films Category:1960s black comedy films Category:1960s satirical films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British black comedy films Category:British Lion Films films Category:British satirical films Category:1960s English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Don Chaffey Category:Films scored by John Barry (composer) Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Films shot at Shepperton Studios Category:1960s British films
