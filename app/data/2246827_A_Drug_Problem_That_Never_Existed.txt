A Drug Problem That Never Existed is the second studio album by American rock band Mondo Generator. It takes its name from a line in The Frogs' "I've Got Drugs (Out of the Mist)", from their album It's Only Right and Natural. Much of the material was inspired by mixed emotions brought about by the divorce of singer Nick Oliveri and also his substance abuses and the death of his father. The tracks "Jr. High Love" and "Day I Die" were previously recorded by Oliveri and others at The Desert Sessions, "Jr. High Love" for Volumes 3 & 4 and "Day I Die" for Volumes 5 & 6 under the name "I'm Dead". "Girl's Like Christ" is a reworking of a Dwarves song "There She Goes Again" written by Blag Dahlia and Nick Oliveri during his time with the band. ==Track listing== Several editions contain an advert for future releases of RekordsRekords as a hidden track. ==Credits== ===Band members=== * Nick Oliveri * Brant Bjork * Molly McGuire * Dave Catching ===Additional musicians=== * Rex Everything * Pierre Pressure * Mark Lanegan * Josh Homme * Troy Van Leeuwen * Josh Freese * Ashlee S. * Marc Diamond * Sean D. * Blag Jesus * Alain Johannes * Carlo Von Sexron ===Additional credits=== Produced by Nick Oliveri, Brad Cook, & Blag Dahlia, except "Detroit" & "Day I Die" produced by Nick Oliveri.
