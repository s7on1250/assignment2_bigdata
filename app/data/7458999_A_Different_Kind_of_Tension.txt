In Uncut, David Cavanagh observed that the album was divided between an unsurprisingly punk-flavoured first half and an experimental second half which harkened to the future. == Track listing == ==Personnel== ;Buzzcocks * Pete Shelley – guitar (left channel), vocals, keyboards * Steve Diggle – guitar (right channel), vocals * Steve Garvey – bass guitar * John Maher – drums ;Technical * Martin Rushent – producer/engineer * Nick Froome – second engineer * George Peckham – mastering * Richard Boon – management * Malcolm Garrett – artwork * Kevin Cummins – photography (Shelley) * Jill Furmanovsky – photography (group) * Peter Monks – photography (Maher) * Gervaise Soeurouge – photography (Garvey) * Judith Wrightson – photography (Diggle) ==Charts== Chart (1979–80) Peak position US Billboard 200 163 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1979 albums Category:Buzzcocks albums Category:Albums produced by Martin Rushent Category:United Artists Records albums Category:I.R.S.
