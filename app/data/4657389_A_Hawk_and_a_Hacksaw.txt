Don Quixote was written in 1605. This quotation comes from William Shakespeare's Hamlet probably written in 1600; I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw. The original quote was changed from "Handsaw" to "Hacksaw" to reference the Aksak meter that is prevalent in Balkan and Turkish music. In the original Don Quixote, Cervantes contrasted black and white rather than a hawk and a hand-saw. The Tobias Smollett translation, however, reads, "...therefore, let every man lay his hand upon his heart and not pretend to mistake an hawk for a hand-saw; for, we are all as God made us, and many of us much worse." Barnes explained the name as "when I was starting [the band], I felt like – and I still do feel like - Don Quixote". ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *A Hawk and a Hacksaw (2002 – Cloud Recordings, 2004 re-issue - The Leaf Label) *Darkness at Noon (2005 – The Leaf Label) *The Way the Wind Blows (2006 – The Leaf Label) *Délivrance (2009 – The Leaf Label) *Cervantine (2011 – L.M.
