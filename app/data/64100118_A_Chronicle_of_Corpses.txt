A Chronicle of Corpses imagines the horror movie as seen through a telescope, making full use of artfully composed long takes that reduce victims to insignificant pinpoints on the horizon. Scurrying back and forth across the lawns of a musty 19th century estate, cloaked by an all-pervasive darkness, the aristocratic Elliott family is actually being destroyed by the weight of ever-shifting American history and Gothic tradition."Kipp, Jeremiah.

As long as you fulfill certain genre expectations -- or actively don't go in the direction of those expectations -- you have a 'horror film.' A Chronicle of Corpses appears to both 'embrace and reject conventions' because the movie is ultimately interpretive, impressionistic -- an open text. It is not up for the film (or the film's director) to decide how or what the picture is finally, but for the viewer to work with, and become part of, the text and interface with it in his or her own way."Curnutte, Richard A.

Page 10. === Writing === McElhinney has stated that the A Chronicle of Corpses screenplay, "was pretty set by the time we went into rehearsal (which I'm not sure was a good thing in the end) but Kevin Mitchell Martin who plays Mr. Elliot was actually so in tune with my style for that film and understood his character so deftly that he improv-ed his monologue ("I feel so hungry to remember . . .") right before the woods tracking shot where his character disappears." === Casting === Marj Dusay On the occasion of her death (2020), Film International published a fond remembrance of Marj Dusay (Grandmother Elliot) by McElhinney.McElhinney, Andrew Repasky.

The director recalled meeting Dusay: "Marj and I met by chance at the New York-Avignon Film Festival in 1998... I was/am a huge Guiding Light fan and loved her Alexandra Spaulding on the show... Marj had just done Love Walked In and said the independent film was a nice change of pace from soap work. I mentioned specific scenes from various projects, the way she had played them, and how they impressed me. I believe she was flattered. Finally, I asked if Marj would look at a script in about six-month's time for what was going to be my next movie. Marj said to call her when I was ready and I did."McElhinney, Andrew Repasky.

"I met Dave in 1987 when I was nine. I already loved the theater, and had asked my parents to take me to a bookstore that only sold play scripts. We landed at the old Drama Book Store on the second floor of 7th Avenue and 48th Street and their Dave was. I remember asking him for a play – I wanted something avant-garde and provocative -- something along the lines of Frank Wedekind. Not quite giving me what I wanted, David handed me a copy of his favorite play, Thornton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth. We became fast friends and soon no trip to New York ... was complete without a stop-in to see Dave." McElhinney continues, remarking: "As an actor Dave was amazing. I wish we had the chance to work together more. Dave's method was an incredible hodge-podge between total confidence and equally total confusion. Dave feared the spotlight as much as he loved it, and it – and the process -- made him humble. And great. And the pauses! No one this side of John Wayne in a Howard Hawks movie could take a pause like Dave."McElhinney, Andrew Repasky. "David Semonin Eulogy" in the David Semonin Memory Book (Judy Binus, editor).

Dennis Lim, in The Village Voice, wrote that A Chronicle of Corpses was “Easily the most peculiar American indie to play New York theaters this year... alternately flamboyant and minimal... Abe Holtz's resourceful camera switches between fussy, iconic frescoes and showboat prowls. ...rancid opulence and humid religiosity.”Lim, Dennis. "Vicious Cycles." The Village Voice [New York], 23 October 2001. https://vvstaging.villagevoice.com/2001/10/23/vicious-cycles Film Threat said A Chronicle of Corpses “is an uncommonly well-photographed film, remarkably lush and opulent in its lighting and shadow play."Hall, Phil.

Carrie Rickey noted the controversial nature of A Chronicle of Corpses writing, “Lit like Vermeer and reminiscent of avant-garde movies such as Jean-Marie Straub’s Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach, McElhinney's piece may be too arty for the scare crowd and too scary for the art crowd. But the filmmaker establishes an atmosphere as pungent as formaldehyde.” Variety's David Rooney wrote that the film showed "more chutzpah and cine-literacy than actual talent" and that "whether the result is artful or artless is a matter of opinion."Rooney, David.

Writing about A Chronicle of Corpses in the Cleveland Free Times, Milan Paurich confessed, "After only one viewing of this odd, hermetic fever dream, I'm not sure whether it's a masterpiece or an audacious stunt. But it feels one-of-a-kind, and sometimes that's enough in today's increasingly formulaic indie landscape, where Kevin Smith imitators routinely butt heads with Quentin Tarantino wannabes."Paurich, Milan.
