thumb|upright|right A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth is a 1982 fantasy role-playing game supplement published by Iron Crown Enterprises. ==Contents== A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth is the first official material based on Tolkien's epic fantasies, and the first release in ICE's series of play aids for adventuring in Middle Earth. ==Reception== William A. Barton reviewed A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth in The Space Gamer No. 57. Barton commented that "Overall, the real usefulness of Middle Earth as a campaign aid will have to wait for subsequent modules in the series to be proven. Unless you're an absolute Tolkien fanatic and don't mind paying [...] you may want to hold off purchasing this one until others in the series are available for evaluation." Jonathan Sutherland reviewed the Guidebook and Gridded Map for White Dwarf #50, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that "The most useful section contains the trade routes, language areas and climate maps. Altogether, a useful package, if a little expensive, but because of the beautifully reproduced map." ==References== Category:Middle-earth Role Playing supplements Category:Role- playing game supplements introduced in 1982
