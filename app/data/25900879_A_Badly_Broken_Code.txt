A Badly Broken Code is the debut studio album by Dessa, a member of Minneapolis indie hip hop collective Doomtree. It was released by Doomtree Records in 2010. The album title comes from a line in the poem "Nostalgia" by American poet Billy Collins. ==Reception== Jakob Dorof of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, "The result is likely one of the best hip- hop songs you'll hear this year, let alone from the rare type of MC that manages to be white, female, and supremely talented all in one." The A.V. Club listed it as the 20th best album of 2010. In 2010, City Pages listed it as the "Best Local Album of the Past 12 Months". The track "The Bullpen" was frequently used as walk out music at rallies by Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar during her 2020 Democratic presidential primaries campaign. ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart Peak position US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard) 13 US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 48 US Rap Albums (Billboard) 22 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010 debut albums Category:Dessa albums Category:Doomtree Records albums Category:Albums produced by Lazerbeak
