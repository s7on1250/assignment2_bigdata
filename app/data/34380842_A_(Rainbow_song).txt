There were even some members who cried. There’s also a lot of pressure in that we have to work harder and do better. We’re still very grateful and thankful for our position on the charts. Since we’re already receiving so much love, we’re really not anticipating a rise in the weekly charts. For the remainder of our stay here, we’re just going to do our best." ===Charts=== ====Oricon==== Oricon Chart Peak Debut sales Sales total Daily Singles Chart 3 24,082 44,858 Weekly Singles Chart 3 Monthly Singles Chart 18 Yearly Singles Chart 172 ====Other charts==== Chart Peak position Billboard Japan Hot 100 4 RIAJ Digital Track Chart weekly top 100 15 ==Ab dance controversy== The "ab dance" in Rainbow's choreography was banned from broadcasting on September 8, 2010, because it was "too sexually suggestive". The dance move involves the group lifting their shirts up to the point where their abdomen or stomach can be seen before taking them down again which was deemed similar to a strip tease. The music video was also age restricted on YouTube, but DSP retired the restriction. They started promoting the song without the "ab dance" on September 11. However, when the group promoted the song in Japan they were allowed to perform the dance, and referred to it as the "belly dance". ==Release history== Country Date Format Label South Korea August 12, 2010 Digital download, Promotional single DSP Media Japan September 7, 2011 Digital download Universal Sigma September 14, 2011 CD single ==References== ==External links== * "A" (Japanese) music video teaser (DSP version) on YouTube * "A" (Japanese) music video teaser (Universal Music Japan version) on YouTube * "A" (Korean) music video on YouTube * "A" (Korean) music video teaser on YouTube Category:2010 songs Category:2010 singles Category:2011 singles Category:Rainbow (girl group) songs Category:Korean-language songs Category:Japanese-language songs
