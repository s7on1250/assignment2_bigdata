The first of these women is unnamed and kept secret from Juan, while the second was the older sister of Juan's mother. ==Reception== The New York Times wrote "Marías's challenging and seductive technique reaches its pinnacle in A Heart So White." The Independent wrote that it "starts from a suicide to explore the secrets of two marriages with all the hypnotic, even sinister, beauty of his style" BOMB magazine described it as "traditional" and "refreshingly un-American." Marías and the translator Margaret Jull Costa were the joint winners of the International Dublin Literary Awards. ==References== ==External links== *"Stranger Than Fiction," by Wendy Lesser, New York Times, May 6, 2001. *A Heart So White reviewed by Ben Donnelly, Review of Contemporary Fiction, Spring 2001.
