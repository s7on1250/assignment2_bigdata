Outfitted with phony ears, a fuzzy tail, and a revealing costume, Gloria learns the proper method of serving drinks, the "bunny dip", and how to fend off customers who ignore Hefner's "look but don't touch" policy. She also concludes that being a sex object, even a chaste one, is depressingly demeaningâ€”an "awakening". ==Cast== * Kirstie Alley as Gloria Steinem * Cotter Smith as Ned Holcomb * Deborah Van Valkenburgh as Pearl * Joanna Kerns as Andrea * Lisa Pelikan as Lee * Delta Burke as Margie * Mary Woronov as Miss Renfro * Diana Scarwid as Toby * Romy Windsor as Bobbi * Randi Brooks as Marybeth * Dee Dee Rescher as Hazel * Chick Vennera as Frankie * Stanley Kamel as Jerry * James T.
