When he arrives, it is too late: his wife Ashley was brutally murdered. Three years later, Vincent moves to New York, and his neighbor, Alice Parker (Béart), is frantically in love with him, but having been always distressed and obsessed to discover the assassin of his woman, he himself does not recognize any feeling at least. To make Vincent be free to open his heart to her, Alice is willing to find the man responsible for his wife's death. When Alice hails a cab driven by lonely New Yorker Roger Culkin (Keitel), her elaborate plan is slowly set into motion in spite of the ignorance of both men. ==Cast== * Emmanuelle Béart as Alice Parker * Norman Reedus as Vincent Harris * Harvey Keitel as Roger Culkin * Joe Grifasi as Bill * Lily Rabe as Sophie * Kim Director as Ashley Harris * Chuck Cooper as Will * Ted Koch as Scott * Ben Wang as Chinese Man * Stephen Payne as Mark * Brian Tarantina as Joe * Patrick Collins as Ben * Clem Cheung as Li Huang * Jonathan Lam as "Baby-Face" * Natalie Caron as Jenny ==References== ==External links== * * *Movieforum: TIFF 2006: "UN CRIME" *Twitch - TIFF Report: UN CRIME Review Category:2006 films Category:2006 crime thriller films Category:French neo-noir films Category:English-language French films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films directed by Manuel Pradal Category:French crime thriller films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s French films Category:English-language crime thriller films
