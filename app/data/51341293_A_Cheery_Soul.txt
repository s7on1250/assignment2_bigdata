The artist had many sittings with the actor and has said of it: "Miss Docker's moments of isolation on stage also suggested a formal structure [for the painting] based on a famous 17th century portrait by Diego Vel√°squez of the actor Pablo de Valladolid, a buffoon in the court of King Phillip IV of Spain." The artist also said: "perhaps this painting is something of an anti-portrait, a reminder that we are to some degree actors, projecting various versions of ourselves..." ==1966 TV adaptation== It was adapted for British TV in 1966 on the BBC.1966 TV Version at IMDbA Cheery Soul at BFI The Daily Mirror called it tedious. == References == == External links == Category:1963 plays Category:Plays by Patrick White
