A John Prine Christmas is the 11th studio album by American folk singer John Prine, released in 1993. "If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man" is a duet with Margo Timmins, lead singer of the Cowboy Junkies. ==Reception== Writing for Allmusic, critic Ronnie D. Lankford Jr. wrote of the album "this isn't the run-of-the-mill holiday product, and Prine can still write a good song when he sets his mind to it. Old fans will be glad to see that even cynics can age gracefully." Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a 1-star Honorable Mention rating. ==Track listing== #"Everything Is Cool" (John Prine) – 3:24 #"All the Best" (Prine) – 4:34 (live) #"Silent Night All Day Long " – 3:52 #"If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man" (Michael Timmins) – 4:36 (live) #"Silver Bells" (Ray Evans, Jay Livingston) – 3:57 #"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" (Tommie Connor) – 3:06 #"Christmas in Prison" (Prine) – 3:59 (live) #"A John Prine Christmas" (Prine) – 5:10 ==References== Category:John Prine albums Category:1993 Christmas albums Category:Christmas albums by American artists Category:Oh Boy Records albums Category:Folk Christmas albums Category:Country Christmas albums
