A Breeze of Hope () is a Bolivian nonprofit 501(c)(3) charitable organization that provides free legal, social, and psychological support to victims of sexual violence. The charitable organization is globally partnered with Equality Now. Over the course of 14 years, the organization's legal team, has prosecuted 500 abuse cases. ==History== Brisa de √Ångulo, an advocate and survivor of sexual abuse, founded A Breeze of Hope in 2004 to address the urgent need for support and justice for sexually abused children in Bolivia. She experienced repeated rape by a family member at 16, and her decision to report the abuse was met with intimidation and blame from her community, extended family, and the authorities. ==Work== In 2013, A Breeze of Hope's advocacy before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights successfully pressured the Bolivian Government to repeal the Rape-Marriage law, a law that pardoned sexual aggressors of their crimes if they married their victims. The first school-based study on the scope of sexual violence against children and adolescents in Bolivia was undertaken in 2009 by the A Breeze of Hope Foundation in collaboration with the Bolivian Ministry of Education and Towson University. They discovered that 1 in 3 girls said they had experienced sexual assault before turning 18. ==References== Category:Sexual abuse advocacy and support groups Category:Incestual abuse Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Foreign charities operating in Bolivia Category:Organizations established in 2004
