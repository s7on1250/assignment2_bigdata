Another intending traveller in a similar plight is Marguerite Hickett, an old friend of Peter's from the days before their marriages. They decide to hire a motor car and drive to Somerset, but the car breaks down and they seek refuge at the local inn. Only one bedroom is available, and as it is very clear that the landlady, Mrs Spoker, will not admit an unmarried couple, Peter and Marguerite check in as husband and wife. Barbara jumps to the conclusion that Peter and Marguerite have run away together. First her parents, Major and Mrs Bone, and then Marguerite's husband and finally Barbara descend on the inn. It becomes clear to everyone that Peter and Marguerite are blameless, and both couples are reconciled. ==Cast== *Major Bone – Tom Walls* *Peter Wyckham – Ralph Lynn* *Marguerite Hickett – Yvonne Arnaud* *Mrs Spoker – Mary Brough* *The Rev.
