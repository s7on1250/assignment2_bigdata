A Lesson in History (, ) is a 1957 joint Soviet–Bulgarian historical drama film directed by Lev Arnshtam and Hristo Piskov about Georgi Dimitrov and the Leipzig Trial. ==Plot== The year is 1933. Georgi Dimitrov (Stefan Savov) comes to Berlin to establish links with the local Bulgarian communists. The Nazi leaders are doing their best to break the resistance of the Communists. Hermann Göring (Yuri Averin) conceives a provocation: during the arson of the Reichstag, his associate must be caught with a ticket of a member of the Communist Party. The Reichstag is set on fire, the provocateur Marinus van der Lubbe (Georgi Kaloyanchev) and the deputy of the Reichstag Ernst Torgler are arrested. Mass repressions against Communists are commencing. Dimitrov also falls in the hands of the Nazi court. However, in the courtroom, workers, including Heinrich Lange (Gennadi Yudin), prove the falsehood of the accusation. The National Socialists are forced to free Dimitrov. The Soviet government grants him the right of political asylum. ==Cast== * Stefan Savov – Georgi Dimitrov * Tzvetana Arnaudova – Paraskeva Dimitrova * Ivan Tonev – Stefcho * Gennadi Yudin – Heinrich Lange * Borya Burlyaev – Vili Lange * Apollon Yachnitskiy – Hitler * Yuri Averin – Gyoring * Pyotr Berezov – Himler * Encho Tagarov – Gyobels * Nikolay Volkov – Heldorf ==External links== * Category:1957 films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Films directed by Lev Arnshtam Category:Georgi Dimitrov Category:Bulgarian historical drama films Category:Soviet historical drama films Category:Russian historical drama films Category:Cultural depictions of politicians Category:Cultural depictions of Bulgarian men Category:Films set in 1933 Category:Films set in Leipzig Category:1950s historical drama films
