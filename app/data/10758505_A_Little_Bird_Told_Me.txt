Patrick; 1910–1973), who was African American - lost a case in United States District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division, against Decca Records, Inc., a large record label. :* In 1948, Supreme recorded in Los Angeles and released "A Little Bird Told Me", written by Harvey Oliver Brooks (1899–1968), sung by Paula Watson (1927–2003), who is African American, accompanied by guitarist Mitchell "Tiny" Webb, and others. Her version enjoyed a fourteen-week run on the Billboard R&B; chart in 1948 and 1949, reaching number 2 on the R&B; charts and number 6 on the pop charts. :* In 1948, Decca Records, recorded in New York and released a cover version, sung by Evelyn Knight (1917–2007), who is Caucasian. Knight copied Watson's singing, precisely - to the degree that it fooled musical experts brought into court as witnesses. Knight was accompanied by a band that included Walter Page on bass, the Stardusters (vocal group), and Johnny Parker (vocal and hand-clapping). : Supreme claimed that Decca had stolen aspects of its original recording, including its arrangement, texture, and vocal style. Race was not an issue in the case, but the case served as a notorious example of white performers covering the work of black artists in the 1950s. : The Court ruled in favor of the defense - upholding a ruling that musical arrangements are not copyrightable property - individual interpretations or arrangements of a given style could not be protested under the law. This case opened the door for cover versions. : Black & White Record Distributors, Inc., had been one of the two original plaintiffs, but withdrew on a motion by the defendant, leaving Supreme as the sole plaintiff. Black & White participated in the case because it had been the manufacturer and distributor of Supreme's line. Separately from the "Little Bird" case, Supreme had sued Black & White, contending that B&W; had no right to turn over its line to two Canadian firms, Monogram and Dominion, who had been pressing and distributing in Canada. On April 2, 1949, Supreme and B&W; settled their dispute, out of court. : Supreme was soon entirely out of business, and by December 1949, Paula Watson was working for Decca. ==See also== *List of number-one singles of 1949 (U.S.) ==Bibliography== ===Notes=== ===References=== * * * * * , , . * , . * , , , .
