A Haunting We Will Go is a 1949 animated short directed by Seymour Kneitel and narrated again by Frank Gallop, featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost. == Production == It is the final Noveltoons cartoon featuring Casper, before he would be given his own cartoon series. == Plot == Casper the Friendly Ghost, sad that he can make no friends since everyone he meets is afraid of him, hatches an abandoned egg and becomes the emerging little duck's best friend ("Dudley") and protector. Casper continues to try and teach his new best friend the ways of being a duck, and gives Dudley a rough idea on how to swim—but with no surprise, Dudley takes to it—like a duck to water. More perils persist as Casper rescues Dudley from a Duck Hunter as a decoy plot thickens. == Additional Voice Cast == * Cecil Roy voices Casper * Jack Mercer voices Turtle, Hunter * Mae Questel voices Ghost Teacher (uncredited) == References == == External links == * Category:1949 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:American animated short films Category:1940s English-language films Category:Casper the Friendly Ghost films Category:1940s animated short films Category:Paramount Pictures short films Category:1949 short films Category:Animated films about ducks Category:American ghost films
