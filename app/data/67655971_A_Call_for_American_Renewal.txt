A Call for American Renewal is an American political manifesto released on May 13, 2021, by 150 members and former members of the Republican Party. It calls for strengthening the rule of law and increasing government ethics. The manifesto was released one day after the ousting of Representative Liz Cheney as chair of the House Republican Conference, and was largely seen as a reaction against the influence of Trumpism within the Republican Party.
