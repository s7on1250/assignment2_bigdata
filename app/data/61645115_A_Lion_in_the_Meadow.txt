A Lion in the Meadow is the first children's book written by the New Zealand author Margaret Mahy. Illustrations done by London artist, Jenny Williams. The book was first published in 1969 and won the 1975 Esther Glen Award. It was also one of the books chosen to accompany Mahy's 2002 Hans Christian Andersen Award nomination. The book was reissued in 1989 with a kinder ending. == Plot == A Lion in the Meadow follows a little boy who believes there is a lion living in a meadow behind his house. == Art == The art work presented is captured in many unique ways. It fumbles upon distinctive swirls, shapes, and colors that emphasizes the story line. The pictures by Jenny Williams has a slightly trippy vibe. With bold swirls and pinks, oranges and purples reflect the little boy's imagination and are mirrored by the mother's clothes and interior decor in the house. == Themes == The theme of the story is surrounded around the idea of over parenting, and taking a over bearing stance on child development. One where the parent tries to limit and restrict the imagination of the child. ==References== 4\. “A Lion in the Meadow.” Hachette Aotearoa New Zealand, www.hachette.co.nz/book/?id=a-lion-in-the-meadow-9781869713904. 5\.
