Legend commented that "the song and the video are about a magical night where you meet someone you immediately connect with and can envision a future together [...] You’re single, dating, probably using all the apps people use now (I haven’t dated since the advent of Tinder, etc, but it’s a fascinating era in romance), and not finding someone special. But one night – maybe caught up in the music or the drinks or whatever – you meet someone that changes everything." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of "A Good Night." *Backing vocals — Raye, Sasha Sloan *Engineer — Mark "Exit" Goodchild *Guitar — Johnny Natural *Keyboards, bass — Ely Rise *Mastering — Chris Gehringer *Mixing — John Hanes, Serban Ghenea *Production, drums — BloodPop *Writing — John Stephens, Michael Diamond, Rachel Keen, Sasha Sloan ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2018) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2018) Position US Adult R&B; Songs (Billboard) 24 ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:John Legend songs Category:BloodPop songs Category:Songs about nights Category:Song recordings produced by BloodPop Category:Songs written by BloodPop Category:Songs written by John Legend Category:Songs written by Raye (singer) Category:Songs written by Sasha Alex Sloan
