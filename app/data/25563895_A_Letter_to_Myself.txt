A Letter to Myself is the fifth studio album by American soul group The Chi- Lites, produced and largely written by lead singer Eugene Record. The album was released in 1973 on the Brunswick label. ==History== The first single released from the album was "We Need Order" and the song peaked at #13 on the R&B; chart and #61 on Billboard Hot 100. The title track was released as the second single and peaked at #3 on the R&B; chart and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was the third of four consecutive Chi-Lites albums to make the R&B; top 5 (reaching #4), but has only a moderate critical reputation, with none of the tracks being considered as strong as the highlights on (For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People or A Lonely Man. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Eugene Record, Marshall Thompson, Robert "Squirrel" Lester, Creadel "Red" Jones - vocals *Thomas (Tom Tom) Washington - piano *Arthur Hoyle, Raymond Orr, Murray Watson - trumpets *Murray Watson, Raymond Orr - flugelhorn *Cliff Davis - baritone saxophone, flute, tenor saxophone, alto saxophone *Gene Barge - alto saxophone *Frank Robinson - tenor saxophone, flute *William A.
