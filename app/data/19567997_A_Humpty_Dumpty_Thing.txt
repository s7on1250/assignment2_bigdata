A Humpty Dumpty Thing is the title of the 2007 solo album by Jim Bob, formerly of Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine. It was released on Cherry Red Records and included a free book. "The story is set in the not-too-distant future when all art is commissioned by the State. It's about a man chosen to write an 80,000-word novel or face a jail term. He's never written anything before and finds himself with instant writer's block."Interview with Alex Ogg for My Favourite Flavour magazine issue 002 November/December 2007 ==Track listing== #"All the King's Horses" #"Cartoon Dad" #"Every Day When I Come Home I Expect to Find You Gone" #"God's Blog" #"Robin, Patrik and Chris" #"Another Day at the Office" #"The Carousel" #"This Phoney War" #"Pizza Boy" #"Battling the Bottle (Fighting the Flab, At War with the World)" #"Why Can't We Get Along?" #"From This Moment" #"The I Can't Face the World Today Blues" == Notes == Category:2007 albums Category:Jim Bob albums Category:Cherry Red Records albums
