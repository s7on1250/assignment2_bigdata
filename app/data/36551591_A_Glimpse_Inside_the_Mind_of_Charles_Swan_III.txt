"I haven't played many gigs on a beach with a Hammond organ, you know?" Hayes, who has made music under the name Plush since the early 1990s, was contacted by Coppola after the director became a huge fan. "I just got so absorbed by his music", Coppola told GQ (UK) about Hayes and Plush. The result of this appreciation was Hayes and Coppola making a soundtrack out of Hayes' music. "It evolved", says Hayes. "When we met to discuss the project we talked about possible songs. We talked some more, added a few more songs, and I ended up doing the score." Hayes also appears in the film performing the tune "So Much Music". It is not his first time onscreen: In 2000 he appeared in High Fidelity performing his song "Soaring and Boring". ==Release== First premiered at the Rome Film Festival in November 2012. On January 8, 2013, the film was released through video on demand and was released in a limited release in the United States on February 8, 2013. ==Home media== It was released on Blu-ray and DVD on May 14, 2013 in North America. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III received an overwhelmingly negative response from critics. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the movie an F, saying that "it isn't a movie so much as a feature-length perfume commercial for a Charlie Sheen signature cologne with gorgeous packaging and absolutely nothing inside." The Dallas Observer said that the film "might generously be described as cut-and- paste â€“ or more accurately as 'throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks'" and it was "a clunker". The New York Daily News gave Charles Swan III one star out of five, saying that "you want to swat it away" and that "maybe with this out of his [Coppola's] system, he'll think up something better." Time said that the film "does not lead to a deeper understanding of Charlie Sheen. It does, however, demonstrate his compulsion for poor judgment and bad choices. But weren't we already convinced of that?" Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewer for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a C and a milder response, writing, "The idea of this home-movie-with-higher-production-values directed by Roman Coppola is no less sweet for being unoriginal ... The execution, on the other hand, is perilously self-absorbed, a private party involving friends, family, too many fantasy sequences, and an abundance of costume and set design to create a notion of a stylized L.A. spritzed with eau de Playboy." The film holds a 16% "rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 56 reviews. The site's consensus reads: "Tiresomely self-indulgent and lacking any storytelling cohesion, this Glimpse Inside the Mind finds little food for thought." Metacritic gave the film a 28/100 "generally unfavorable" approval rating based on 22 reviews. === Box office === The film opened at #64 with US$12,000 in its limited release at two theaters the week of February 8. The following weekend, the weekend of February 15, Charles Swan III expanded to 18 theaters and gained an 81.6% increase. As of July 11, 2013, the domestic total of A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III is US$45,350, and in Russia the film has grossed $134,473, with an additional $26,999 in Mexico. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Roman Coppola Category:2012 comedy films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:2012 films Category:Films with screenplays by Roman Coppola Category:A24 (company) films Category:American comedy films Category:American Zoetrope films Category:Films scored by Roger Neill Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films
