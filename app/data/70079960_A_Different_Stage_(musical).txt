A Different Stage is a one-man show with music and lyrics by Gary Barlow and a book by Tim Firth. The show received its world premiere, close to Barlow's home town of Frodsham, in Runcorn at The Brindley in February 2022 before embarking on a tour around the UK. The show tells the story of Barlow's life in his own words reflecting on his career, friendships and personal life. Barlow worked on his first theatrical project in 2013 where he signed up to work on a new musical version of Finding Neverland which ran on Broadway for 17 months in 2015. Barlow then went on to co-write The Girls (later retitled in 2017 as Calendar Girls The Musical) which opened in London's West End in January 2017 before producing a UK & Ireland tour of the second Take That musical The Band in 2017 which visited London and Germany. == Productions == === UK & Ireland Tour (2022) === On 20th January 2022, it was announced the show would premiere at The Brindley, Runcorn before embarking on a UK Tour.
