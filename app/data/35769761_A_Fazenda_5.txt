A Fazenda 5 was the fifth season of the Brazilian reality television series A Fazenda which premiered Tuesday, May 29, 2012, at 10:30 p.m. on RecordTV. The season was officially confirmed since 2011 as part of a millionaire contract between Strix Television and Record, which guaranteed seasons until 2019. Britto Junior and Chris Couto reprised their hosting stints for the show. Celso Cavallini made his debut as the show's new special correspondent, replacing Tina Roma. The grand prize was of R$2 million without tax allowances. ==Production== ===Overview=== Pre-production started in January 2012. At first, the fifth season was scheduled to premiere early April but was postponed to mid June since the producers believed that launching the new season right after the finale of Big Brother Brasil 12 could hurt the show due to the similarities in both formats. On May 9, 2012, it was announced that the season would premiere May 30, 2012 in order to make way for the 2012 Summer Olympics and to avoid clashing with Globo's new 11 pm soap opera Gabriela. On 15 May, it was announced that the premiere was anticipated to May 29, 2012. ==Contestants== The complete cast list was leaked 24 hours before the season premiere.
