The only problem is that Derrick's best friend Jay (Roberts) can't find a date for the party. Bitter at being snubbed by his best friend for a girl, Jay invites everyone in the hood to Derrick's party and it's not too long before the house is overflowing with eager party seekers. ==External links== * * Category:2005 films Category:2005 comedy films Category:African- American comedy films Category:2005 directorial debut films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films
