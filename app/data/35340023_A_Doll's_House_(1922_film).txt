His wife Nora (Nazimova) forges her father's name to a bank note to raise money to save her husband's life. Six years later, when she has but one payment left on the note, Nils Krogstad (Nowell) threatens to expose her unless she intercedes and prevents her husband from discharging him from the bank. Nora begs her husband to have Krogstad remain. Torvald learns her reason for her request and accuses Nora unjustly. When Krogstad returns Nora's note marked "paid," Torvald is overjoyed that his own reputation is saved, and agrees to overlook the past. Nora, however, decides that her first duty is to be a human being and leaves her husband and children. She walks out into the storm and declares that it is "the end and the beginning." ==Cast== * Alan Hale as Torvald Helmer * Alla Nazimova as Nora Helmer * Nigel De Brulier as Dr. Rank * Elinor Oliver as Anna * Wedgwood Nowell as Nils Krogstad * Clara Lee as Ellen * Florence Fisher as Mrs. Linden * Philippe De Lacy as Ivar * Barbara Maier as Emmy ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1922 films Category:American silent feature films Category:Films based on A Doll's House Category:Lost American films Category:1922 drama films Category:Silent American drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:United Artists films Category:Lost drama films Category:1922 lost films Category:1920s American films
