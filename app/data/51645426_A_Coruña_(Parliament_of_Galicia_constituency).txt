A Coruña (, ) is one of the four constituencies () represented in the Parliament of Galicia, the regional legislature of the autonomous community of Galicia. The constituency currently elects 25 deputies. Its boundaries correspond to those of the Spanish province of A Coruña. The electoral system uses the D'Hondt method and a closed-list proportional representation, with a minimum threshold of five percent. ==Electoral system== The constituency was created as per the Statute of Autonomy for Galicia of 1981 and was first contested in the 1981 regional election. The Statute provided for the four provinces in Galicia—A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense and Pontevedra—to be established as multi-member districts in the Parliament of Galicia, with this regulation being maintained under the 1985 regional electoral law. Each constituency is entitled to an initial minimum of 10 seats, with the remaining 35 being distributed in proportion to their populations. In the 1981 and 1985 elections, each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats: 22 for A Coruña, 15 for Lugo, 15 for Ourense and 19 for Pontevedra. Voting is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in Galicia and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Amendments to the electoral law in 2011 required for Galicians abroad to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as "begged" or expat vote (). Seats are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes—which includes blank ballots; until a 1993 reform, the threshold was set at three percent—being applied in each constituency. The use of the D'Hondt method may result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the district magnitude. The electoral law allows for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call—fifteen before 1985—whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election—one- thousandth of the electorate, with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures, until 1985—disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. ==Deputies== Deputies 1981–present Parliament Election Distribution 1st 1981 {| style="width:27.5em; font-size:90%; text- align:center; font-family:Courier New;" 1 1 6 5 9 ==Elections== ===2020 regional election=== Summary of the 12 July 2020 Parliament of Galicia election results in A Coruña Parties and alliances Popular vote Seats Votes % ±pp Total +/− People's Party (PP) 263,293 49.15 +1.34 14 +1 Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG) 133,144 24.86 +16.06 7 +5 Socialists' Party of Galicia (PSdeG–PSOE) 89,767 16.76 –0.41 4 –1 Galicia in Common–Renewal–Tides (Podemos–EU–Anova)1 23,757 4.43 –14.96 0 –5 Vox (Vox) 11,359 2.12 New 0 ±0 Citizens–Party of the Citizenry (Cs) 2,943 0.55 –2.79 0 ±0 Animalist Party Against Mistreatment of Animals (PACMA) 2,503 0.47 –0.59 0 ±0 Galicianist Tide (En Marea–CxG–PG)2 1,289 0.24 –0.09 0 ±0 Equo Galicia (Equo) 505 0.09 New 0 ±0 Zero Cuts–Common Space–The Greens–Municipalists (RC–EsCo–OV–M) 468 0.09 –0.06 0 ±0 Communist Party of the Workers of Galicia (PCTG) 364 0.07 New 0 ±0 For a Fairer World (PUM+J) 353 0.07 New 0 ±0 Libertarian Party (P–LIB) 312 0.06 +0.02 0 ±0 Democratic Centre Coalition–Self-employed (CCD–AUTONOMO) 266 0.05 New 0 ±0 Blank ballots 5,352 1.00 –0.14 Total 535,675 25 ±0 Valid votes 535,675 99.20 +0.14 Invalid votes 4,321 0.80 –0.14 Votes cast / turnout 539,996 49.63 –4.42 Abstentions 548,068 50.37 +4.42 Registered voters 1,088,064 Sources ===2016 regional election=== Summary of the 25 September 2016 Parliament of Galicia election results in A Coruña Parties and alliances Popular vote Seats Votes % ±pp Total +/− People's Party (PP) 278,295 47.81 +2.42 13 ±0 In Tide (En Marea)1 112,893 19.39 +2.78 5 +1 Socialists' Party of Galicia (PSdeG–PSOE) 99,934 17.17 –1.61 5 ±0 Galician Nationalist Bloc–We–Galician Candidacy (BNG–Nós) 51,246 8.80 –0.81 2 ±0 Citizens–Party of the Citizenry (C's) 19,419 3.34 New 0 ±0 Animalist Party Against Mistreatment of Animals (PACMA) 6,198 1.06 +0.45 0 ±0 Commitment to Galicia (CxG) 1,898 0.33 –0.62 0 ±0 Zero Cuts–Green Group (Recortes Cero–GV) 883 0.15 New 0 ±0 Let's Win Galicia: Yes We Can (Gañemos) 875 0.15 New 0 ±0 Anti-Corruption and Justice Party (PAyJ) 848 0.15 New 0 ±0 Citizens–Centrum (C–C) 840 0.14 New 0 ±0 Communists of Galicia (PCPE–CdG) 629 0.11 –0.05 0 ±0 Independent Alternative of Galicia (AIG) 367 0.06 New 0 ±0 United for the Future!
