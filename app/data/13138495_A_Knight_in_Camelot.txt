She is sent back along with many objects from her desk, including her laptop and boom box. As she is sentenced to be burned at the stake, she discovers among the laptop-data, that there will be a solar eclipse in short time. With her "magical powers" she makes the sun re-appear and is being knighted by King Arthur as Sir Boss and becomes a member of the Knights of the Round Table. She soon begins constructing devices that will not be present for many centuries, she saves the king, defeats Sir Sagramore and saves the day countless times before being zapped back to the present. ==Cast== * Whoopi Goldberg as Dr. Vivien Morgan/Sir Boss * Michael York as King Arthur * Paloma Baeza as Sandy * Simon Fenton as Clarence * James Coombes as Sir Lancelot * Robert Addie as Sir Sagramore * Ian Richardson as Merlin * Amanda Donohoe as Queen Guinevere * John Guerrasio as Bob * Steve Speirs as Head of arms ==See also== *List of films featuring eclipses ==External links== * * Category:American television films Category:Arthurian films Category:Films based on American novels Category:1998 television films Category:1998 films Category:Films based on A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court Category:Films directed by Roger Young Category:American fantasy comedy films Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Films shot in Northumberland Category:1990s English-language films Category:Television shows based on works by Mark Twain Category:1990s American films
