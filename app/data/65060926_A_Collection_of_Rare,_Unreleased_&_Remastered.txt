A Collection of Rare, Unreleased & Remastered is the compilation album by Mentallo & The Fixer, released on April 27, 2012 by Alfa Matrix. ==Reception== In reviewing A Collection of Rare, Unreleased & Remastered, Peter Marks of Brutal Resonance criticized the music for not aging well but acknowledged that he preferred the albums Mentallo & The Fixer produced after Dwayne Dassing departed from the band. Lollipop Magazine stated "Texan electro-industrial act Mentallo & The Fixer has been at it for a while, and that knowledge shows on the lean, effective "decomposed (spent)." Peek-A-Boo Magazine criticized the collection for being excessive, saying "slimming it down to three or even two cd's would have been possible, maybe even with a few free downloads of remixes/reworked songs." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the A Collection of Rare, Unreleased & Remastered liner notes.
