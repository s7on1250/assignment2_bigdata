A City Dressed in Dynamite is the debut album by That Handsome Devil, released in 2008. It was recorded at Cybersound Studios in Boston, Massachusetts. The songs featured on the album are darker in tone and content than those on the band's debut EP, with some dealing explicitly with drug addiction and death.
