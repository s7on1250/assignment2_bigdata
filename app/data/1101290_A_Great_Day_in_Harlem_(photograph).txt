thumb|right|A Great Day in Harlem A Great Day in Harlem or Harlem 1958 is a black-and-white photograph of 57 jazz musicians in Harlem, New York, taken by freelance photographer Art Kane for Esquire magazine on August 12, 1958. The idea for the photo came from Esquire's art director, Robert Benton, rather than Kane. However, after being given the commission, it seems the latter was responsible for choosing the location for the shoot. The subjects are shown at 17 East 126th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenue, where police had temporarily blocked off traffic. Published as the centrefold of the January 1959 ("Golden Age of Jazz") issue of Esquire, the image was captured with a Hasselblad camera, and earned Kane his first Art Directors Club of New York gold medal for photography. It has been called "the most iconic photograph in jazz history". The scene portrayed is something of an anachronism, as by 1957 Harlem was no longer the "hotbed" of jazz it had been in the 1940s, and had "forfeited its place in sun" to 52nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. Many musicians who were formerly resident in the area had already moved to middle class parts of New York, or did so shortly thereafter. Kane himself was not that certain who would turn up on the day, as Esquire staff had merely issued a general invitation through the local musicians' union, recording studios, music writers, and nightclub owners. In 2018, a book was published to mark the 60th anniversary of the event, with forewords by Quincy Jones and Benny Golson, and an introduction by Kane's son, Jonathan. ==Musicians in the photograph== * Red Allen * Buster Bailey * Count Basie * Emmett Berry * Art Blakey * Lawrence Brown * Scoville Browne * Buck Clayton * Bill Crump[ Allmusic Bill Crump biography] * Vic Dickenson * Roy Eldridge * Art Farmer * Bud Freeman * Dizzy Gillespie * Tyree Glenn * Benny Golson * Sonny Greer * Johnny Griffin * Gigi Gryce * Coleman Hawkins * J.C.

Notable absentees were Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis (all touring), Duke Ellington (in Milwaukee), Benny Goodman (in Los Angeles), and Ella Fitzgerald (recording in Chicago). Ruby Braff, Billie Holiday, and Ben Webster were also not present. ==Children in the picture== Count Basie, having grown tired of standing, sat down on the curb, and gradually a dozen children followed. Most of the children were neighborhood residents, although the second child from the right, Taft Jordan, Jr., had accompanied his father, Taft Jordan, to the photo session. The photography crew was already having trouble directing the adults, and the presence of the children added to the chaos: one of the children appearing in the window kept yelling at a sibling on the curb; another kept playing with Basie's hat; Taft Jordan, Jr. had been scuffling with the older child seated to his left. Ultimately, Art Kane realized that any further attempt to organize the proceedings would be futile, and he decided to incorporate the subjects' actions. ==Musicians in other photographs== Ronnie Free, Mose Allison and Charlie Rouse arrived too late to participate in the Esquire shoot, but were photographed by Dizzy Gillespie alongside Mary Lou Williams, Lester Young and Oscar Pettiford. ==Film== Jean Bach, a radio producer of New York, recounted the story behind the photograph in her 1994 documentary film, A Great Day in Harlem. This incorporated 8 mm film footage taken by bassist Milt Hinton on the day of the shoot. The film was nominated in 1995 for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Bach described how, upon the film's release, a number of similar photographs employed the "A Great Day in..." theme. Hugh Hefner assembled Hollywood-area musicians for "A Great Day in Hollywood" in conjunction with a sneak preview of A Great Day in Harlem. Soon after, "A Great Day in Philadelphia" included musicians such as Jimmy Heath, Benny Golson and Ray Bryant. During the filming of Kansas City (1996), musicians including Jay McShann posed for "A Great Day in Kansas City". A multi-page supplement in The Star-Ledger featured "A Great Day in Jersey", while a Dutch photograph was titled "A Great Day in Haarlem". In 1998, "Great Day in St Paul" was taken by Byron Nelson.Andrea Canter, "Attention All Twin Cities Jazz Artists! “Great Day in St Paul” Photo Shoot May 22!", Jazz Police, May 9, 2016 The trend spread to other styles of music, with Houston blues musicians posing for "A Great Day in Houston". "A Great Day in Hip Hop" was followed by XXL's "The Greatest Day in Hip Hop". An Atlanta radio station gathered musicians for "A Great Day in Doo-Wop". A New York cellist, inspired by both the original photograph and the film, assembled chamber musicians for "A Great Day in New York". The New York Post ran "A Great Day in Spanish Harlem". The photograph was a key plot point in Steven Spielberg's 2004 film The Terminal. The film starred Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a character who comes to the United States in search of Benny Golson's autograph, with which he can complete his deceased father's collection of autographs from the musicians pictured in the photo. Golson himself made a cameo appearance in the film.Lorne Graham, "A Great Day in Harlem/The Terminal", NEMC article."The Terminal - Jazz Scenes - Benny Golson and A Great Day in Harlem", YouTube ==Homages== * 1998: "A Great Day in Hip-Hop" — for this photograph by Gordon Parks, commissioned by XXL magazine, 177 hip-hop artists gathered on the stoop of number 17 as well as those of the buildings on either side.Michael A.
