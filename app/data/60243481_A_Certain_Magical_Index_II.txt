Yuka Iguchi revealed that Nishikiori instructed her to act "like a big shot with no proof" during recording. Rina Satō also revealed that the staff told her about Mikoto Misaka, her character, falling in love with Toma Kamijo in the second season but felt that their current rivalry was the "best way to go". Kishō Taniyama enjoyed Stiyl Magnus' teasing and tsundere-like nature, and noted that his character was "unbearable". Nozomi Sasaki revealed how she was told to bring out Misaka 10032's "individual differences" among the Misaka clones for the second season, which she found difficult to do since she eliminated it in the first season. ===Casting=== In June 2010, Atsushi Abe, Iguchi, and Satō were set to reprise their respective roles as Kamijo, Index, and Misaka.

Despite the flaws of the show, such as having "horribly overwritten dialogue[s]", he praised it for advancing the "storylines on both scientific and magical fronts", its action sequences, and giving viewers "opportunities to have fun with characters both old and new". Ian Wolf of Anime UK News scored the series 8 out of 10, calling its action "better" than the first season, while pointing out the "violence" in the show and finding the factions' names ("Roman Orthodox Church" for Roman Catholic Church and "English Puritan Church" for Church of England) "weird". ===Accolade=== Okamoto won Best Supporting Actor at the 5th Seiyu Awards for his role as Accelerator. ==Note== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2010 anime television series debuts Category:A Certain Magical Index Category:A Certain Magical Index episode lists Category:J.C.Staff
