Light entertainment that, like 'non- alcoholic' beer, simply lacks the gestalt of reality." In a 1994 survey of wargames, the magazine gave the title two-plus stars out of five, stating that it "is not an accurate representation of the Gulf War" but that the other scenarios were "more interesting". ==References== ==External links== * *Review in PC World Category:1992 video games Category:Computer wargames Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Video games based on board games Category:Video games developed in the United States
