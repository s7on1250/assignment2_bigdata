"A House Is Not a Home" is a 1964 ballad written by the team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the 1964 film of the same name, starring Shelley Winters and Robert Taylor. The song was recorded by American singer Dionne Warwick at Bell Sound Studios in New York City, and was a modest hit in the United States for the singer, peaking at #71 on the pop singles chart as the B-side of the top 40 single, "You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)". Another version of the song, by Brook Benton, which was the version that appeared in the film, was released at nearly the same time. It debuted two weeks earlier on the Billboard Hot 100. Benton's version split airplay with Warwick's, and ultimately peaked at #75. Warwick's version of "A House Is Not a Home" fared better in Canada, where it was a top 40 hit, peaking at #37. The ballad made the R&B; top 10 in Cashbox by both Warwick and Benton, with neither artist specified as best seller. Despite its modest initial success, the song went on to achieve greater renown through frequent recordings by other artists, including a hit version in 1981 by Luther Vandross. ==Production== The Warwick single was performed in the key of F major, and it is most often played in that key in jazz interpretations. Bacharach recorded and performs the song in the key of A-flat major. ==Luther Vandross version== The song was recorded by R&B;/soul singer-songwriter Luther Vandross on his 1981 debut album Never Too Much. The track, which was recorded at seven minutes long, was released as a single and became an R&B; hit, and later one of Vandross's signature songs. His performance of the song at the 1988 NAACP Awards telecast would bring Warwick to tears. In 2009, Essence magazine included Vandross's version of the song in their list of the "25 Best Slow Jams of All Time". Vandross's version was sampled by Kanye West for "Slow Jamz", from Twista's 2004 album Kamikaze, as well as Kanye's own 2004 studio album The College Dropout. === Certifications === ==Other versions== * Following the original singles by Warwick and Benton, Bacharach himself recorded the song for his 1965 debut Hit Maker!: Burt Bacharach plays the Burt Bacharach Hits. *Ella Fitzgerald included this on her 1969 live album Sunshine of Your Love. * * The Temptations and The Supremes recorded a version for their joint album * * Julie Rogers recorded the song for her 1964 debut album Julie Rogers (which also featured her rendition of "The Love of a Boy"). * * Ronnie Carroll recorded the song for his 1965 album Carroll Calling. * * The Anita Kerr Singers recorded an a cappella arrangement on their 1969 album Reflect. * * Della Reese recorded a version for her 1967 album Della on Strings of Blue. * * Lainie Kazan recorded a version for her 1968 album Love is Lainie. * * Cher released a version on her 1968 album Backstage. * * Shirley Bassey included a version on her 1968 album 12 of Those Songs. * * Mavis Staples recorded the song for her 1969 album Mavis Staples. * * British singer Lulu recorded the song for her 1969 album Lulu's Album. * * English rock duo The Marbles performed the song and was released on the group's 1970 self-titled album. * * Dusty Springfield performed the song with Bacharach on the 1970 television special Another Evening With Burt Bacharach (a performance she was "quite proud of").Dusty: Full Circle – Taragon Video * * Barbra Streisand recorded a medley of the song with "One Less Bell to Answer" (the 5th Dimension hit) for her 1971 album Barbra Joan Streisand. * * Dakota Staton recorded the song for her 1972 album with organist Groove Holmes "Madame Foo-Foo". * * Sarah Vaughan recorded the song for her 1975 album Sarah Vaughan with the Jimmy Rowles Quintet. * * American pop singer Viola Wills covered the song in her unique dance/Hi-NRG style and released it as a single only with radio, vocal and house remixes in 1994.
