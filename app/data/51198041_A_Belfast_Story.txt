Set in a city which has weathered hundreds of years of hatred, 30 years of bombs, and a war without winners, just victims. A new era brings new risks. There is peace, but that can also be deadly ==Cast== *Colm Meaney as Detective *Malcolm Sinclair as Chief Constable *Maggie Cronin as Sinead *Tommy O'Neill as First Minister Owen McKenna *Damien Hasson as Damien *Patrick Rocks as Eammon *Peter O'Toole as Alley victim ==Reception== The film received negative reviews and has a 14% "Rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review, "Nathan Todd attempts something similar in his debut feature, a murder mystery with political overtones, but his inexperience lets him down badly." He also added, "not even [Meaney's] heavyweight gravitas can save A Belfast Story from its weak script, sluggish pacing and one-dimensional characters." Steve Rose of The Guardian gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, "the plot scatters too many pieces about, putting the film's star off screen for long stretches." ==Controversy== A month before its release, the film garnered controversy in Great Britain for the filmmakers' publicity stunt of sending a nail bomb kit to the media to promote the film. Nathan Todd later issued an apology. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 crime films Category:Films scored by Nick Glennie-Smith Category:Films set in Belfast Category:Films from Northern Ireland Category:2013 directorial debut films Category:2010s English-language films
