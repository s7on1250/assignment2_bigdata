A Blaze of Glory is the first of a new 4-book series, set more in the "Western" theater of the Civil War. This first volume covers the Battle of Shiloh. (The title comes from a marvelous quote from General (later President) James Garfield, who was present at the battle). The novel takes place in the Spring of 1862 and focuses on Confederate Generals Albert Sidney Johnson and P. G. T. Beauregard, as well as then Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest; and Union Generals Ulysses S Grant, Don Carlos Buell, and William Tecumseh Sherman at the Battle of Shiloh. ==References== ==External links== * Jeff Shaara's Official Site Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels set during the American Civil War Category:Novels by Jeffrey Shaara Category:Ballantine Books books
