Le Magnétiseur, sold in the United States as A Hypnotist at Work and in Britain as While Under a Hypnotist's Influence, was an 1897 French short silent film by Georges Méliès. It was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 129 in its catalogues. The film is one of a small group of risqué "mature subjects" (i.e. stag films) Méliès made around this time; others included Peeping Tom at the Seaside, A Private Dinner, and After the Ball. A Hypnotist at Work is currently presumed lost. ==References== ==External links== * Category:French black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:French silent short films Category:Lost French films Category:1890s lost films Category:1897 short films Category:1890s French films
