A Grande Família ()Globo TV International - Big Family is a Brazilian television sitcom created by Oduvaldo Vianna Filho and Armando Costa which originally aired on Rede Globo from March 29, 2001 to September 11, 2014. The show tells the story of a typical middle-class family living in a suburb neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. It is a remake of the series of the same name that aired in Brazil in the 1970s. The family consists of a working father, Lineu, a housewife and mother, Nenê, their son Tuco, their daughter Bebel, and Bebel's fiancée, Agostinho, a taxi driver portrayed as the typical carioca malandro. The family's grandfather, Floriano, was written out of the story after the death of actor Rogério Cardoso. In addition to being the longest- running Brazilian sitcom, the show it is considered one of the most popular comedy shows in Brazil. A film based on the series premiered on January 10, 2007. ==Plot== Lineu (Marco Nanini), the head of the family and quintessential patriarch, acts like a father to everyone in the house, including to his street-wise son-in-law, the hilarious Agostinho (Pedro Cardoso). Lineu is as methodical and strait-laced as Agostinho is roguish and full of mischief. Lineu is married to the sweet Nené (Marieta Severo), and unlike most long- married couples, they are still passionately in love. Bebel (Guta Stresser) is their dreamer daughter whose head is constantly in the clouds. And, of course, she could only be married to Agostinho. This family couldn't be complete without the eternal teenager Tuco (Lúcio Mauro Filho), a real mommy's boy who doesn't get any breaks from his dad. == Cast and characters == Summary of character appearances Character Portrayed by Appearance count Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Lineu Silva Marco Nanini 489 (All) colspan="14" rowspan="5" Nenê Silva Marieta Severo Bebel Silva Guta Stresser Tuco Silva Lúcio Mauro Filho Agostinho Carrara (Tinho) Pedro Cardoso Seu Flor Rogério Cardoso 92 colspan="3" colspan="11" Marilda Andréa Beltrão 219 colspan="8" colspan="4" Beiçola Marcos de Oliveira 310 colspan="14" Paulão Evandro Mesquita 185 colspan="4" colspan="10" Mendonça Tonico Pereira 132 colspan="13" Florianinho Vinícius Moreno 56 colspan="11" colspan="3" Gina Natália Lage 69 colspan="6" colspan="5" colspan="3" ==Episodes== Season Episodes Originally aired DVD and Blu-ray year release Season premiere Season finale Region 1 Region 2 Region 4 1 36 2002DVD A Grande Família 2 37 2003Dvd A Grande Família 2 3 2009DVD A Grande Família - Seleção de Episódios de 2001 a 2006 4 30 5 36 6 37 7 8 38 9 36 10 2010DVD A Grande Família 10 anos - 2 DVDs 11 38 12 13 26 14 23 ==Reception== ===Awards and nominations=== It has won many different awards, including 7 Extra Awards, 3 Arte e Qualidade, one APCA award and a nomination for an Emmy Award for the role of actor Pedro Cardoso. ==References == ==External links== * * Category:2001 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2014 Brazilian television series endings Category:Brazilian comedy television series Category:Mass media portrayals of the middle class Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:Rede Globo original programming Category:Television shows adapted into films Category:Television series about families Category:Television shows set in Rio de Janeiro (city)
