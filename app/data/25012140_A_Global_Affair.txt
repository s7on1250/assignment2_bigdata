A Global Affair is a 1964 American comedy film directed by Jack Arnold, and starring Bob Hope, Michèle Mercier, Yvonne De Carlo, and Elga Andersen. ==Plot== A baby is abandoned at the United Nations headquarters in New York by a mother who heard the UN's Frank Larrimore speak out on behalf of children's rights via a radio show. Found by UN guide Lisette, she brings the baby to the security office. Because the baby is in international territory, her nationality unknown, Frank (a proud bachelor) is begrudgingly forced to take the baby back to his apartment until a proper home can be found. His landlord forbids kids, so Frank smuggles the child into his apartment. Lisette initially finds Frank to be abrasive and unfit to take care of a child, and believes Frank and his pal Randy are using it as a way to meet beautiful, wedding-minded single women. But, Lisette eventually reads his proposal for the "Universal Rights of a Child', and they fall in love. After a series of mishaps, Frank finally earns her forgiveness and love, and they adopt the baby. ==Cast== * Bob Hope as Frank Larrimore * Michèle Mercier as Lisette * Robert Sterling as Randy * Yvonne De Carlo as Dolores * Elga Andersen as Yvette * Miiko Taka as Fumiko * Lilo Pulver as Sonya * John McGiver as Mr. Snifter * Nehemiah Persoff as Segura * Jacques Bergerac as Duval * Mickey Shaughnessy as Police Officer Dugan * Rafer Johnson as Ambassador * Adlai Stevenson as himself * Hugh Downs as himself ==External links== * * Category:1964 films Category:1964 comedy films Category:American black-and- white films Category:American comedy films Category:1960s English-language films Category:Films directed by Jack Arnold Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Lederer Category:Films about the United Nations Category:Films about orphans Category:1960s American films Category:English-language comedy films
