She tells him she is going away for a week with her friend May to Portsea where there are many nice boys. Nellie gets the dates wrong and goes a day early. When James finds out he worries she is cheating on him. His client Rouse comes in and says he is convinced his wife is cheating on him a man called Dane. They hire three private eyes from Sleath's Detective Agency, Hall, Ratchet and Moon, to keep an eye on women. The bungling of these private investigators provides the film's slight humor. In the end, both men realize their wives are faithful and all's well that ends well. ==Cast== *Donalda Warne as Nellie O'Neill *John D'Arcy as James Lord *Patricia Minchin as May *Ed Warrington as Hall *Oliver Peacock as Ratchet *George Moon as Moloney ==Production== The film was directed by a young European, E.A. Dietrich-Derrick and was written by Monty Grover, editor of Melbourne tabloid The Sun. It was the first film produced by Efftee and was shot between April and June 1931. ==Release== Diggers (1931) was originally meant to be released on a double bill with The Haunted Barn. However that movie encountered censorship problems and A Co- respondent's Course, although shot later, was selected to support Diggers instead. It encountered trouble from the Victorian censor. Peter Fitzpatrick, biographer of F.W. Thring, later wrote that the film was "heavy-going": > The lack of action in many of its dialogue scenes is exacerbated by the > static single-take camera work, and by an excessive concern with > circumstantial realism that produces 'book-ends' of extended hellos and > goodbyes in many scenes, and excruciatingly prolonged telephone calls in > which phone numbers are always carefully enunciated and there are long > pauses while the caller listens patiently to someone whom we cannot see or > hear. And a lot of the conversation is stagey and stilted. Still... the > film... [has] at least a period charm.Fitzpatrick p 146 Fitzpatrick though the movie was partly redeemed by making fun of the absurdity of its male characters and use of external locations.Fitzpatrick p 148 ==See also== *Cinema of Australia ==References== *Fitzpatrick, Peter, The Two Frank Thrings, Monash University, 2012 ==External links== *A Co- respondent's Course at National Film and Sound Archive Category:Australian comedy short films Category:1931 films Category:1931 short films
