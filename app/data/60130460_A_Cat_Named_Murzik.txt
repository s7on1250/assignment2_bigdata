A Cat Named Murzik is the fourth studio album from the American folk band Murzik. ==About== The eight-track album was self-released, on 1 May 2012. It was recorded at Aladdin Studios, mixed by Alex Proctor, and engineered and produced by Bryan Steenerson. It is described as having "romanticized soundscapes and dark poetic lyrics," and it draws comparison to the music of DeVotchKa, Gogol Bordello, Nick Cave, and Leonard Cohen. A Cat Named Murzik features accordion, mandolin, glockenspiels, and acoustic and electric guitars, with the baritone vocals. A record released party was held at Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 19 May 2012, with Bella Ruse. The album was reissued with Mint 400 Records in 2015. A review by John Ziegler in Duluth News Tribune says, "combining the zestiness of gypsy swing with the somber tones of some Eastern European folk music[,] there's a definite minor key vibe that comingles with the lyrics' darker shades lending a very distinct flavor to A Cat Named Murzik." He describes the opening track "Poison Tears" as blending "a flamenco feel with driving percussion and featur[ing] an undulating middle section, following the first verses, that almost stops time." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Christopher Becknell – violin *Alex Budrow – drums *Ryan Pfeiffer – cello *Nathan Simar – accordion *Bryan Steenerson – vocals and guitar *Darin Steenerson – bass ;Additional musicians *Jeremy Grace – piano *Alex Proctor – bass ==References== ;Citations ;Bibliography * * * * * Category:2012 albums Category:Folk albums by American artists Category:Mint 400 Records albums
