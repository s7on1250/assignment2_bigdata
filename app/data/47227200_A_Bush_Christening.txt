Paterson It has been called "a rollicking account of how the traditional pre-occupations, whisky and religion, come together".The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, 2nd edition, p136 ==Plot summary== ‘Mike was the dad of a ten-year-old lad’ (stanza 2, line 5) who has never been christened. Magee lives "On the outer Barcoo where the churches are few,"(stanza 1, line 1) and rarely sees a priest. By chance a priest passes by one day and his parents decide to christen the boy as soon as possible. The Magee (son) overhears the conversation, and, thinking that a "christening" is like branding of animals, decides to make a run for it. The priest and parents chase after him. They see that they have no chance of catching the runaway boy, ‘so the priest, flung a flask at his head that was labelled ‘Maginnis Whisky’ (stanza 11, line 43, 44). Thereafter the boy is known and christened as "Maginnis Magee". He grows up to be a justice of the peace who hates to be asked how he came to be christened "Maginnis". ==See also== * 1893 in poetry * 1893 in literature * 1893 in Australian literature * Australian literature ==Notes== The poem has been linked by Australian literary researcher Lucy Sussex to an anonymous story, "Peggy's Christening", in the Colonial Monthly, April 1868. ==Further publications== * The Man from Snowy River and Other Verses by Banjo Paterson (1895) * From the Ballads to Brennan edited by T.
