He has already witnessed the death of his mother and beloved older brother by the time he befriends Jonathan, who comes from a sheltered family. After Bobby finds his father is dead, Jonathan's family takes him in. Bobby and Jonathan become best friends, and also experiment sexually. The two eventually lose touch, but meet up again in their 20s in 1980s New York, where Bobby moves in with Jonathan and his eccentric roommate Clare. Clare had planned to have a baby with Jonathan (who is openly gay), but Bobby and Clare become lovers, while Jonathan still has feelings for Bobby. Clare and Bobby have a baby and move to a country home together with Jonathan. The trio form their own family, questioning traditional definitions of family and love, while dealing with the complications of their polyamourous relationship. == Adaptations == * A Home at the End of the World (2004), film directed by Michael Mayer == External links == * Category:1990 American novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Novels by Michael Cunningham Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:Novels with gay themes Category:1990s LGBT novels Category:Works originally published in The New Yorker Category:American LGBT novels
