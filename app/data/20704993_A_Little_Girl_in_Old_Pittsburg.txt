A Little Girl in Old Pittsburg is a novel for children set in late 18th century Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania written by the American writer Amanda Minnie Douglas (1831-1916). It opens in 1781 with the news of Lord Cornwallis’ surrender to George Washington as it reaches the Carrick, Bradin, and Duvernay families, pioneers who live near Fort Pitt. The protagonist, Daffodil, is the "little girl" of the title, and the plot primarily is used to illustrate the domestic life of early Pittsburghers. It ends with Daffodil’s marriage and her taking leave of the city. The novel is part of a series (e.g., A Little Girl in Old Boston, A Little Girl in Old Philadelphia) that was among the first fiction series for American girls. ==See also== *List of fiction set in Pittsburgh ==References== Category:1909 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Children's historical novels Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh Category:Novels set in the 1780s Category:Dodd, Mead & Co. books Category:1909 children's books Category:Children's books set in the 1780s Category:Children's books set in Pittsburgh
