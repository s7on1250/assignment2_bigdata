Before leaving her, her father buys her new clothes and a cake to convince her that she is going on a trip. This coincides with the Korean title, which literally means "traveler" or "tourist". In the orphanage, she tries to come to grips with the abandonment by her father and insecurities about a possible adoption. She gradually makes friendships, although she retains the belief that her father will return to take her back, and struggles (sometimes violently) not to adjust to her surroundings. In the end, Jin-hee is adopted by French parents who are eagerly waiting for her at an airport to meet their new child. ==Cast== * Kim Sae-ron as Jin-hee * Park Do-yeon as Sook-hee * Go Ah-sung as Ye-shin * Park Myung- shin as a nanny * Sol Kyung-gu as Jin-hee's father * Oh Man-seok as Director Goo * Shin Young-sik as Ye-shin's foster father * Moon Sung-keun as a doctor * Richard Wilson as puppeteer/U.S. soldier * Rob Youngs as Sook-hee's adoptive father * Luke Doyle as guitarist/U.S. soldier * Harvey Schmidt as Jin-hee adoptive father ==References== ==External links== * http://cafe.naver.com/traveler2009 * * * Category:2009 films Category:French drama films Category:South Korean drama films Category:2000s Korean-language films Category:Films shot in Seoul Category:2000s French films Category:2000s South Korean films
