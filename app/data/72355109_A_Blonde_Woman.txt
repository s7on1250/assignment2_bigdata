thumb|300px|A Blonde Woman (Flora) A Blonde Woman, also called Flora, is an oil painting by Palma Vecchio, dated today to around 1520, but undocumented before 1870, in the collection of the National Gallery, London. This half- length depiction of a woman in loosened white chemise with a dark green mantle, holding some flowers, has been interpreted as an idealised representation of female beauty (sometimes in connection with the Roman goddess Flora), and as an actual portrait of either a gentlewoman or a courtesan. ==Description== The picture was painted in oils on a wood panel measuring 77.5 cm by 64.1 cm (2 ft 6½ in by 2 ft 3¾ in); a strip 2.54 cm (1 in) high has been added along the top of the panel, lengthening it. It is in very good condition, with most of the repainting concentrated in the side of the face and hair which is cast in shadow.Gould 1975; repr. 1987, p. 187. The subject is a young woman with fair skin and blonde carefully tended silken hair sweeping about her shoulders, who shows much décolletée; her white chemise or camicia is unfastened and slipping off her shoulder, baring her right breast and nipple, and there is a little piece of narrow blue ribbon, designed to fasten the chemise. In her right hand is a small bunch of colourful spring flowers.Richter 1910, i. p. 129.Richter 1910, i. pp. 133–134.Kren, et al., eds. 2018, p. 346. ==Date== By comparing Palma's treatment of the subject's coiffure with similar styles in pictures by contemporary Venetian artists, such as Lorenzo Lotto, the picture has been dated to about 1520.Gould 1975; repr. 1987, p. 188. Jean Paul Richter, writing in 1910, thought the picture representative of Palma's work during the previous decade, from 1510 to 1520, and allied in composition with the "beautiful series of portraits" now preserved in the Gallery of Vienna.Richter 1910, i. p. 130. The work has been compared to Palma's Sibyl, which is also dated to the 1520s.Royal Collection Trust. In Venus and Cupid in a Landscape, another work by Palma, dated by the Fitzwilliam Museum, where it hangs, to about 1523 or 1524,Fitzwilliam Museum. Venus has the same dimpled chin, and other facial features, as the subject of this painting. ==Analysis== Palma Vecchio is known mainly for religious scenes and portraits of women, and, according to Cecil Gould, this example of the latter group is characteristic of his style.Gould 1975; repr. 1987, pp. 184–185.Humfrey 1995, p. 167. The subject is a young woman of that "opulent voluptuous type", in Richter's phrase, which was much admired in Venice at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and was represented in works by Titian, Palma, Lorenzo Lotto, Bonifazio Veronese, Paris Bordone, and others.Richter 1910, i. p. 133. The character of these works is disputed, as to whether the women represented are simply ideals of female beauty created by the artist, or portraits of actually existing beauties, and, if portraits, of whom.Philipps 1905, p. 26.Humfrey 1995, pp. 167–168. In the National Gallery catalogues, this picture was for many years titled Flora after the ancient Roman goddess of spring and flowers.Richter 1910, i. pp. 129–130. Certain particularities of the composition, such as the posy of forget-me-nots, buttercups (or wall-flowers) and primroses held in the subject's right hand, and the erotic suggestion of the loosened chemise, have drawn comparison with Titian's earlier painting of the same name. Richter, who titles the work Portrait of a Lady, writes of the "cold whiteness" of the chemise which has fallen away from the shoulders, "like the discarded sheath of an opening flower".Richter 1910, i. pp. 129, 134. Gould thinks the influence of Titian likely, though unprovable given the dearth of primary sources for the picture. The identity of the sitter is unknown, and according to Gould impossible to determine given the "summary treatment of the features". Richter, conversely, describes Palma's "carefully individualised heads" of women as portraits.Richter 1910, i. p. 134. Palma painted a number of similar half-lengths of (real or ideal) beauties, and the type became one of his specialities. Such eroticised images were not intended for public exhibition, but to be hung in private apartments,Richter 1910, i. p. 135. and were commissioned by a clientele of wealthy male collectors. There is also evidence that some successful courtesans and mistresses bought and owned alluring portraits of themselves to advertise their charms.National Gallery. Portraits of such well-known women were ordered by their lovers and admirers, who were sometimes even pictured with them. Claude Phillips writes of "the exquisite, golden blond courtezans—or, if you will, models—who constantly appear and reappear in this period of Venetian art".Phillips 1897, p. 52. The connection extends to the name Flora, which was a common alias of prostitutes in Italy from Roman times.Jones 2012.Held 1961, pp. 202–203.Santore 2008, pp. 20–21. This painting has therefore been interpreted as "probably a portrait of a Venetian courtesan". According to Richter, however, although Palma's pictures of women may sometimes depict courtesans, they may equally often be portraits of great ladies, gentlewomen, and brides, whose husbands were simply proud of their beauty.Richter 1910, i. pp. 133–135. ==Provenance== Palma never signed or dated any of his canvases, and although this one is to-day attributed to him based on the style and handling of the composition, the documentation of the picture is completely lacking before 1870.Richter 1910, i. p. 131. On 30 April 1870 it was auctioned by Christie's as lot 53 of the William Delafield sale, with an attribution to Paris Bordone.Richter 1910, i. p. x. The picture was bought from a Dr. Becci in Florence, who had acquired it some time before in England, and was firmly convinced that it was by Leonardo da Vinci. It had previously belonged to a Mr. Delafield.Richter 1910, i. p. 136. It was acquired by Ludwig Mond in 1889, who, just before his death 1909, bequeathed it, along with the most of his collection of Old Master pictures, to the National Gallery, pending the death of his widow, Frida Mond, who lived until 1923.Wardleworth 2003, p. 88. In 1924, after settling a legal dispute with the family, the National Gallery acquired the picture (accession number NG3939) through the Mond bequest. Three copies or versions of the composition have between recorded: # Formerly in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland at Syon House, auctioned by Sotheby's on 26 March 1952 as lot 109. # From an anonymous sale, auctioned by Sotheby's on 12 December 1954 as lot 62. # Sold at Cologne in 1904. The sitter is described as wearing pearls.Spahn 1932, p. 126. == Allusions == * In his 1969 novel Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, Vladimir Nabokov refers to this picture ("a Venetian blonde") and the painter ("a drunken Palma Vecchio").Nabokov 1969, p. 141.Shapiro 2014, p. 156. ==Related works== File:Portrait d'une Femme à sa Toilette, by Titian, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|Titian: Woman with a Mirror, File:Palma il Vecchio 006.jpg|Palma: Young Woman in a Green Dress, File:Jacopo Negretti, called Palma il Vecchio - Young Woman in a Blue Dress, with Fan - Google Art Project.jpg|Palma: Young Woman in a Blue Dress, with Fan, File:Palma il Vecchio - Mars, Venus and Cupid (1520).jpg|Palma: Mars, Venus and Cupid, File:Retrato de una mujer joven llamada "la Bella", por Palma el Viejo.jpg|Palma: "La Bella", File:Palma il Vecchio - Lady With A Lute.jpg|Palma: Lady with a Lute, File:Jacopo Negretti called Palma the Elder - Portrait of a Woman known as Portrait of a Courtesan - Google Art Project.jpg|Palma: A Courtesan, File:1520 Veneto Idealbildnis einer Kurtisane als Flora anagoria.JPG|Bartolomeo Veneto: Young Lady as Flora, File:Francesco Melzi Flora after 2019 conservation.jpg|Melzi: Flora, File:Palma Vecchio (active 1480-1528) - A Sibyl - RCIN 405763 - Royal Collection.jpg|Palma: A Sibyl, File:1525 il Vecchio Frau mit entbloesster Brust anagoria.JPG|Palma: Young Woman with Bare Breast, File:Jacopo Palma il vecchio (c.1480-1528) - Venus and Cupid - 109 - Fitzwilliam Museum.jpg|Palma: Venus and Cupid in a Landscape, File:Diana and Callisto - Palma Vecchio.jpg|Palma: Bathing Nymphs, File:Paris bordon, gli amanti veneziani, 1525-30 ca.
