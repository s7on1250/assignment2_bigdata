It was published in 1842 at the expense of Moore and Governor of Western Australia John Hutt. In 1884 it was republished as part of Moore's Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia and also A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines.A descriptive vocabulary of the language in common use amongst the aborigines of Western Australia; with copious meanings, embodying much interesting information regarding the habits, manners, and customs of the natives, and the natural history of the country. By George Fletcher Moore, B.L., Advocate-General Of Western Australia. The work is a key source in records of the nomenclature of Australia's Southwest flora and fauna. The compilation of regional variants in the Nyungar language is cited in Serventy and Whittell Birds of Western Australia and subsequent ornithological literature, although his own observations of bird-life remained unpublished until the 1884 edition of Moore's diary. ==References== * Moore, George Fletcher (1884).
