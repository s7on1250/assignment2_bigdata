A Feast in Time of Plague () is an 1830 play by Aleksandr Pushkin. The plot concerns a banquet in which the central figure taunts death with a toast "And so, O Plague, we hail thy reign!". The story is based on 4th scene of Act 1 of John Wilson's play "The City of Plague" (1816). The play was written in 1830 and published in 1832 as one of four Little Tragedies (Malenkie tragedii, ) together with The Stone Guest (Kamenny gost', ); Mozart and Salieri (Motsart i Salyeri, ) and The Miserly Knight (Skupoy rytsar, ). All four of these plays were set as one act operas by Russian composers; Dargomyzhsky, Rimsky- Korsakov, Rachmaninov, and for the Feast, CÃ©sar Cui. ==References== * Category:1830 plays Category:Plays by Aleksandr Pushkin Category:Plays adapted into operas
