The song was to be used in the film Say Anything..., but it was ultimately cut from the film because the producers believed the song revealed too much of the story. Backing vocals on the song were provided by Maria Vidal. ==Background== Frontman Pat DiNizio attributed the song's harder guitar sound to new producer Ed Stasium: "[The album had] a heavier guitar sound, like in "A Girl Like You". We were trying to preserve our integrity, yet find a home on radio", lead singer Pat DiNizio said.. Officialsmithereens.com. Retrieved on 25 July 2018. "A Girl Like You" was written by DiNizio on assignment for Cameron Crowe's film Say Anything.... DiNizio based the lyrics on bits of dialogue in the screenplay. When the film's producer asked DiNizio to change the lyrics, because it revealed too much of the plot, he refused, and the band decided to keep the song for their next album, 11. Pat DiNizio stated that he wrote the lyrics with a separate meaning from the movie in mind. Madonna was originally enlisted to sing the harmony vocals, but failed to show up for the recording session. Instead, the band got Maria Vidal to do the vocals. ==Release== "A Girl Like You" was released as the first single from the band's third album, 11.
