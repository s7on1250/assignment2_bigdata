Both J. Lee Thompson's direction and Caryl Ledner's writing are best in the rather coolly dispassionate vignettes peeling down the prideful hero, as in one scene at an unemployment office. But Kennedy's moment of truth, a simple decision to buckle down and roll up his sleeves, take a long, exasperating wait that provokes curiosity, hardly sympathy." The Los Angeles Times said it "ranked among the best workthat director J. Lee Thompson, in his TV movie debut, has ever done."TV MOVIE REVIEW: A Tragedy to Identify With Thomas, Kevin.
