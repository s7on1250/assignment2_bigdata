A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey is a 2013 non-fiction book by Stephen Harper concerning the history of professional ice hockey in Canada during the early 20th century. ==Synopsis== The book follows the development of Toronto's earliest professional hockey teams, particularly the Toronto Professional Hockey Club (1906â€“09) and the Toronto Blueshirts (from 1911). Prior to this, the development of professional teams was fiercely opposed by the Ontario Hockey Association and by Toronto Telegram publisher John Ross Robertson. ==Publication== Harper wrote the book over an eight-year period. It was released on 5 November 2013 by Simon & Schuster. Proceeds from the book's sales support the Canadian Forces Personnel and Family Support Services. The book also covers other aspects of the early- century game such as the development of artificial ice rinks. ==Reception== Perry Lefko's negative review in Quill & Quire deemed that the book "reads like a long-winded essay or thesis from a hockey historian". Globe and Mail reviewer John Allemang noted that "[v]erbal amateurism apart, it's enjoyable to catch traces of a more boyish, playful Stephen Harper". The Toronto Star review of the book also noted the academic style of the book but indicated the presentation of early 20th-century hockey provided a "historical perspective that has received scant attention among all the books devoted to hockey". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:Canadian non-fiction books Category:Ice hockey books Category:History of ice hockey Category:20th-century history books Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Stephen Harper Category:History of the Toronto Maple Leafs
