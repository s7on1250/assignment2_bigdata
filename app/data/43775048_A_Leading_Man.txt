A Leading Man is a 2013 American drama film written and directed by Steven J. Kung as his feature film debut, starring Jack Yang, Heather Mazur, and Tsai Chin. The film is distributed by Mance Media, and premiered on October 17, 2013, at the 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival. The film had theatrical release at the Music Hall theater in Beverly Hills, California on September 26, 2014. ==Background== After witnessing the repeated stereotypical and two- dimensional depictions of Asian Americans in film and television, Kung was inspired to write A Leading Man. He specified examples being media backlash against Jeremy Lin, the "appallingly offensive" stereotypes of Asians on the NBC television series Outsourced, and a SAG-AFTRA report which concluded Asian Americans are underserved within the entertainment industry, coupled with the fact that people were not aware of the issue. He based Jack Yang's character of GQ Chi on an Asian actor friend of his who had had extensive experience and training and who had landed a major role in Broadway theater, whose difficulty finding steady work despite his skills and accomplishments, was "emblematic of how Asian actors are treated in general." With a few key exceptions, casting choices were made with the intent to "cast unknowns to introduce a new generation of Asian American performers". Filming took place during August 2012, with financing provided by Kung's mother, who also held the role of GQ Qi's mother. == Plot == GQ Qi (Jack Yang) finally makes it big playing a coveted role on a television sitcom. Everyone is happy for him – the network, his mother, his best friend – everyone except GQ himself. He is stuck playing an offensive stereotype."FILM REVIEW: A Leading Man by Jimmy Zhang".

Kung found his inspiration. His script highlighting this industry controversy was found "intermittently effective", but it was felt its focus might limit the film's viewership to festivals and home entertainment. However, interest in the film's topic would extend beyond Asian American performers and be of interest to any non-white film industry worker. While the film attempts to "lead by example, the constant remonstrating becomes repetitive as the actors run out of chances to favorably reveal their characters." It was stated that Jack Yang "certainly has the bearing and looks of a leading actor, but the script has him squandering nearly every opportunity to actually deliver a profitable performance," and Heather Mazur role as Rachel Cohen "could have been far more decisive than it turns out to be, diminishing the impact of the role." Bruno Oliver as Mitch Lebowitz was considered notable in that he "effectively embodies every odious characteristic of a clueless, self-centered executive." ===Awards and nominations=== * 2013, nominated for Halekulani Golden Orchid Award for 'Narrative Feature' at Hawaii International Film Festival * 2014, won 'Best Feature Film' at DisOrient Asian American Film Festival * 2014, won Special Jury Prize for 'Best Cinematography - Narrative Feature' at VC FilmFest - Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival * 2014, won 'Best Actor' for Jack Yang at Asians On Film Festival * 2014, won 'Best Supporting Actor' for Raymond Lee at Asians On Film Festival * 2014, won 'Best Drama' at Asians On Film Festival ==References== == External links == * * * * Mance Media Category:2013 films Category:Asian-American drama films Category:Films about Chinese Americans Category:Films about Taiwanese Americans Category:2013 independent films Category:American independent films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Chinese-language films Category:2013 drama films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films
