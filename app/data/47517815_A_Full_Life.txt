A Full Life: Reflections at 90 is a memoir written by Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, released in 2015 on his 90th birthday. The book is a collection of reflections and memories, including his upbringing, political career, and humanitarian efforts. == Contents == The book begins with President Carter's childhood and early life in the Georgia countryside. It covers his early political career, including his service in the Georgia Senate and his run for the governor's office. The book also provides an in- depth look at President Carter's time in the White House and the difficulties he faced. He divides these difficulties into two categories: "Issues Mostly Resolved" and "Problems Still Pending." The first group includes topics such as Rhodesia, the B-1 bomber, the rescue of New York City and Chrysler, and the end of the Cold War. He touches on the significant SALT II Treaty. Among the issues that remain unresolved, Carter highlights drugs, special interests, the potential for nuclear war, and intelligence agencies. He speaks about Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton objectively but does not fully absolve them for their actions.
