A Dictionary of Musical Themes (New York: Crown, 1949) is a reference book by Sam Morgenstern and Harold Barlow. == Background == The book collects together 10,000 musical themes (mostly classical works) and indexes them using a notation index based on transposing the pitches to C major or C minor (so that God Save the Queen/America, for instance, would come out as CCDBCDEEFE). It was followed a year later by A Dictionary of Vocal Themes (1950), including themes from songs and opera. Sam Morgenstern (1906-1989) was a teacher at Mannes College of Music in Greenwich Village, New York, and the conductor of Lower Manhattan's Lemonade Opera Company, which gave the US premiere of Prokofiev’s Duenna in 1948. He composed two short operas himself, along with Warsaw Ghetto (setting a spoken word poem by Harry Granick to background music), which was premiered at Carnegie Hall on February 10, 1946. He also composed a choral cantata The Common Man, and the latin-tinged piano piece Toccata Guatemala. Although there are no recordings of his work, a radio disk transcription of the second performance of Warsaw Ghetto exists, made in the studio a week after the premiere.NYPR Archive Collections Morgenstern’s other books included the anthology Composers on Music (1956).Obituary, New York Times, 30 December 1989, p 31 Co-author Harold Barlow (1915-93), who devised the notation scheme, was a popular song composer who studied violin at Boston University and went on to become a bandleader during World War II.Obituary, Los Angeles Times, 28 February 1993 He wrote the comedy song I’ve Got Tears in My Ears in 1949 (recorded by Homer and Jethro),Homer & Jethro.

The Directory of Tunes and Musical Themes used the contours of a melody, avoiding the need to transpose the notes into C (which involves some musical knowledge). Using the letters U, D and R to denote up, down and repeat, and an asterisk for the first note, “God Save the Queen” comes out as *RUDUU URUDDD UDDU. Parsons covered around 15,000 classical, popular and folk pieces in his dictionary. In the process he found out that *UU is the most popular opening contour, used in 23% of all the themes, something that applies to all the genres.Uitdenbogerd, AL and Yap, Y W. Was Parsons right?
