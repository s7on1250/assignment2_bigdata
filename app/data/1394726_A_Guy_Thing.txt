A Guy Thing is a 2003 American comedy film directed by Chris Koch and starring Jason Lee, Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. ==Plot== Paul Morse (Lee) and Karen Cooper (Blair) are about to get married in Seattle. During his bachelor party, Paul has a chat with one of the dancers at the party, Becky Jackson (Stiles), and they find that they have an affinity for each other. Paul wakes up the next morning and is terrified to see Becky in the bed next to him. Assuming they slept together, Paul rushes Becky out of his apartment and hopes never to see her again. He tries to cover up the connection for the few days before the wedding. Unfortunately, Becky unexpectedly shows up around town and turns out to be Karen's cousin. Even worse, Becky's malicious ex-boyfriend cop Ray Donovan (Munro) had Becky followed and photographed. Becky and Paul meet again to steal those pictures from Ray's apartment. Further problems arise with family and friends consistently showing up at the wrong times. Crabs, dirty underwear in the toilet tank, a horny best friend, and a best man/brother who is in love with the bride all provide for a week of wedding preparation hijinks. Through the snowballing of all his implausible lies and half-truths, Paul receives corroboration and support from an unexpected corner; what seems to be a coordinated network of other men, including friends, complete strangers and, to Paul's astonishment, Karen's own father; all who give the same explanation: "It's a guy thing". ==Cast== * Jason Lee as Paul Morse * Julia Stiles as Becky Jackson * Selma Blair as Karen Cooper * James Brolin as Ken Cooper * Shawn Hatosy as Jim * Lochlyn Munro as Ray Donovan * Diana Scarwid as Sandra Cooper * David Koechner as Buck Morse * Julie Hagerty as Dorothy Morse * Thomas Lennon as Pete Morse * Jackie Burroughs as Aunt Budge * Jay Brazeau as Howard * Larry Miller as Minister Ferris * Matthew Walker as Minister Green * Dylan Winner as Moni Young * Fred Ewanuick as Jeff * Lisa Calder as Tonya * Victor Varnado as Hansberry * Donavon Stinson as Mouthy Bar Guy ==Production== Principal photography took place from November 2001 to February 2002, in Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
