A Lady in Her Bath is an oil on wood painting by French artist François Clouet, created in 1571. ==Description== It measures 92.3 x 81.2 cm (36 5/16 x 31 15/16 in.). The picture is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, and is one of only three paintings signed by Clouet. ==Analysis== The teenaged female bather is unknown. It is possible that she is Diane de Poitiers, mistress of King Henry II of France when she was a teenager. Scholar Roger Trinquet suggested in 1966 that the teenaged lady is Mary Queen of Scots. The lady's face resembles other portraits of Mary, especially a drawing by Clouet depicting Mary in mourning. Trinquet believes the painting was intended as a satire for a Huguenot patron. The painting set a fashion for portraits of bathers. According to scholars, the bather had given birth.
