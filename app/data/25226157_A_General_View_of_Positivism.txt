A General View of Positivism (Discours sur l'ensemble du positivisme) is a 1844 book by the French philosopher Auguste Comte, first published in English in 1865. A founding text in the development of positivism and the discipline of sociology, the work provides a revised and full account of the theory Comte presented earlier in his multi-part The Course in Positive Philosophy (1830â€“1842). Comte outlines the epistemological view of positivism, provides an account of the manner by which sociology should be performed, and describes his law of three stages. ==See also== *Religion of humanity *Sociological positivism ==References== *Comte, A.; Bridges, J.H.
