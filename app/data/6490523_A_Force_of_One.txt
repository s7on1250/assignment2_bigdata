Please note figures are for rentals in US and Canada ===Critical response=== Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, "Though plot is far-fetched and production values aren't much superior to tv fare, likable protagonists and strong karate sequences will carry the day with the intended audience." Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it "a swift, taut, handsomely photographed thriller... made with more craftmanship than most martial arts movies." Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and dismissed it "just a poor excuse for a lot of fighting."Siskel, Gene (February 22, 1980). "Siskel's Flicks Picks". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 12. K.C. Summers of The Washington Post wrote, "It's pretty good. Not only does it move along at a faster clip than many a higher-budget film, but it's done without a lot of gore â€” no small feat in a martial arts movie ... Another plus is that the romantic leads, Jennifer O'Neill and Chuck Norris, actually seem to like one another; they're relaxed and at ease before the camera, and their scenes together are a pleasure to watch."Summers, K.C. (October 12, 1979). Force of One' Gets By Without Gore, Until the End". The Washington Post. Weekend, p. 39. Norris said he was "ten times better in" the film than in his previous film Good Guys Wear Black (1978). The film was written by Ernest Tidyman who in a 1980 interview considered it his least successful effort as a craftsman. "I only wrote it to buy my mother a house." he said, although financially it was one of his biggest hits. ==See also== * Chuck Norris filmography ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1979 films Category:American action films Category:1979 action films Category:American police detective films Category:American independent films Category:American martial arts films Category:1979 martial arts films Category:Martial arts tournament films Category:1979 independent films Category:Films directed by Paul Aaron Category:1970s English-language films Category:1970s American films Category:Films set in San Diego Category:Films shot in San Diego
