"It reproduces the story as closely as it is possible to do in a film and the technical excellence of the work cannot be questioned. The photography, the staging and the acting are all of the best, and the story told is always impressive. â€¦ Such films cannot be too highly commended. They are a welcome relief from the riot of bloodshed which has marred the moving picture shows of New York and other cities far too long. Even though it costs a fortune almost to prepare such a film, it is quite likely that the public will patronize it sufficiently to make good the extraordinary outlay." ==See also== * List of Christmas films * List of ghost films * List of American films of 1908 * List of A Christmas Carol adaptations ==References== ==External links== * Category:1908 films Category:1908 lost films Category:1908 short films Category:1900s ghost films Category:American Christmas films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:Films set in the 1840s Category:American silent short films Category:Essanay Studios films Category:Lost American films Category:1900s Christmas films Category:1900s American films Category:Silent horror films Category:1900s English-language films Category:Silent American fantasy films
