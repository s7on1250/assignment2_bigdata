A Change of Pace is an American five piece pop punk band from Peoria, Arizona, United States. The band was on both the 2005 and 2006 Warped Tours. ==Biography== A Change of Pace formed in 2001 when singer Torry Jasper and drummer Jonathan Kelly began playing together in freshmen year of high school (while attending Centennial High School). In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez, and within a few months they were signed to Immortal Records in August 2004, and released their EP Change Is The Only Constant. In 2005 the band released their first full-length album, An Offer You Can't Refuse, and landed a spot on the Warped Tour. Between October and December 2005, the band embarked on the Myspace Fall Tour across the US. In June 2006, Prepare the Masses was announced, and later released on August 15, 2006. In between this, the band appeared on Warped tour again. The band also added a fifth member to the band, Dan Parker (previously in Don't Let Go). They then went on tour with Roses Are Red. In November 2006, they toured the US with Paulson and InMemory. In March and April 2007, A Change of Pace went on a tour with Quietdrive, the Classic Crime, Sullivan, and thebleedingalarm.

After several discussions, the band agreed to perform at the festival with other acts such as The Early November, Motion City Soundtrack, HelloGoodbye and Cartel. After several meetings, the band decided to work on an album with Torry Jasper. However, this album was never released. ==Prepare The Masses 10th anniversary shows and second breakup== In May 2016, the band announced two concerts to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Prepare The Masses, the first show which took place on July 30, 2016 at The Pressroom in Phoenix, AZ and the second show took place at the Chain Reaction in Anaheim, CA on August 6, 2016.
