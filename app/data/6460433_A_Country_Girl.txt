Squire Challenor spent much of his family fortune to reopen the tin mines near his village in Devonshire in an effort to give employment to the poor people of the region. On the Squire's death, The Squire's son, Geoffrey, in need of funds, leased his family manor to the wealthy Sir Joseph Verity. Geoffrey then went to sea to seek his fortune. Geoffrey's childhood sweetheart, Marjorie, also left the village, but flirtatious Nan stayed at home, spending time with Sir Joseph, his son Douglas and a number of other gentlemen. Five years after Geoffrey left the village, Sir Joseph has plans for Douglas to be elected to Parliament representing the borough. He also has an interest in the influential society lady, Mrs. Quinton Raikes, recently legally decreed a widow following the disappearance of her husband in the Himalayas. Mrs. Raikes resists his advances, but she is short of money. She agrees that Madam Sophie should stay at the manor as a friend to compensate for not being able to pay her bill. Sophie is in seventh heaven, for this is the village where she grew up, and she is delighted to be able to show her old friends how she has risen in the world. Geoffrey Challoner and his faithful friend and assistant, Barry, return from the Orient. Barry realizes that the villagers would much prefer to elect Geoffrey to Parliament than the unenthusiastic Douglas, who is more interested in Nan than the election. Marjorie joy has also come back from London where she has become a singing star under an assumed name. She wants Geoffrey to find her as he left her and, hiding her fine clothes, she dons her old blue dress and sunbonnet for their meeting. Geoffrey's ship has brought some Eastern passengers, the Rajah of Bhong and his fiancée, Princess Mehelaneh. However, the Rajah is an Englishman, and the Princess is a modern young lady. She has insisted on being brought to Britain to be presented at the local Emperor's court before her marriage to the Rajah, and he is strangely anxious to get their business over and leave the country again. The Rajah, it turns out, was once the husband of Mrs. Raikes. It was to escape his wife that he went off to the Himalayas, so he prefers to remain "dead" according to British law. The Princess, on the other hand, is not so anxious to be on her way. She has learned from Barry that in England one may choose (within reason) one's preferred spouse, and she is soon busy sizing up alternatives to her nervous Rajah. Barry attempts to raise money for Geoffrey by selling off the worthless old tin mine to Sir Joseph on the pretext that providing work for the locals will earn his son the votes he needs to win the election. He also discovers that Madam Sophie, now living at the manor, is his old sweetheart. The Princess, who has also installed herself at the manor, has decided that her choice of husband shall be Geoffrey, whom she will bring to her native land. Geoffrey, politely kissing the Princess's hand, declines the oriental match. Marjorie, who has seen only the kiss, tearfully goes back to London and the stage. ;Act II - Interior of the Ministry of Fine Arts. At the London house of Lord Anchester, an old friend of the Rajah, a ball is being held. Attending is Nan, the Rajah, accompanied by the Princess (desperately avoiding his widowed wife and longing for the happy land of Bhong), Sophie, still under the social protection of Mrs. Raikes who clearly hasn't yet paid her dressmaker's bill, and Marjorie Joy in her London persona as Miss Montague. Geoffrey is fascinated by her, as he finds in her an amazing resemblance to his lost sweetheart. Barry is disguised as an old lady to get in past the doorman. Amusing complications ensue, including Sir Joseph's attempts to flirt with the disguised Barry, who seeks refuge in the arms of the surprised Rajah. In the hearing of Miss Montague, Geoffrey squarely refuses the Princess's renewed offer in favour of the love of his 'little country girl'. When Lord Anchester requests the actress to favour the company with a song, she reveals her double identity to a grateful Geoffrey. All pair off happily. ==Musical numbers== thumb|A programme from a 1931 revival starring Dorothy Ward. ;Act I *No. 1 - Chorus & Mummery - "When the birds begin to sing, out we go a-harvestin." *No. 2 - Nan & Chorus - "Johnnie came from London Town for a bit of fun" *No. 3 - Marjorie - "Over the hills and far away, borne on the summer breeze" *No. 4 - Geoffrey & Chorus - "A sailor's life's the life I trow, he works now late, now early" *No. 5 - Barry & Chorus - "I went to sea as a bold A.
