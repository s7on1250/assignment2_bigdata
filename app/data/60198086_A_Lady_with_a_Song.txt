A Lady with a Song is a studio album by American jazz singer Nancy Wilson released by Columbia Records in 1990. The album reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 8 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums chart. The album produced four singles, with two of them reaching the Billboard Hot 100. ==Reception== William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote "The arrangements are full of electronic keyboard washes, popping basslines, and soulful female backup vocals with the occasional piercing saxophone part, all in support of (and at times overwhelming) Wilson's smoky alto vocals... But the quality of the songwriting lets Wilson down, and, anyway, the approach is not natural to her. She is jazzier and classier than this kind of thing, and while she made a valiant attempt to meet the R&B; charts more than halfway, she is not heard at her best here". ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (1990) Peak position US BillboardContemporary Jazz Albums 8 US Billboard Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums 68 Region Certification Certified units/sales Australia (ARIA) 2× Platinum 140,000^ Austria (IFPI Austria) Gold 50,000* Canada (Music Canada) 3× Platinum 300,000^ Denmark (IFPI Denmark) Platinum 100,000 France (SNEP) 3× Platinum 300,000* Germany (BVMI) Platinum 300,000^ Italy (FIMI) Platinum 50,000* Japan (RIAJ) Million 1,000,000* Netherlands (NVPI) Platinum 40,000 Spain (PROMUSICAE) Gold 50,000^ Sweden (GLF) Platinum 100,000^ Switzerland (IFPI Switzerland) Platinum 100,000^ United Kingdom (BPI) 3× Platinum 900,000* United States (RIAA) 6× Platinum 6,000,000* Summaries Europe (IFPI) For sales in 2019 1× Platinum 1,000,000* *sales figures based on certification alone ^shipments figures based on certification alone ==References== Category:1990 albums Category:Nancy Wilson (jazz singer) albums Category:Columbia Records albums
