A Book Like This is the first studio album by Australian singer-songwriter duo Angus & Julia Stone. It was released in September 2007 in Australia and debuted and peaked on the ARIA Charts at number 6. The album was released in the UK through Flock Music/PIAS on 31 March 2008 and an alternative version was released in North America through Nettwerk on 3 March 2009 where the band performed songs from the album on US Radio Station KCRW . At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, the album was nominated for Best Blues and Roots Album, Best Group, Breakthrough Artist and Best Cover Art. ==Reception== Andrew Leahey from AllMusic said "Angus & Julia Stone's debut recalls the lush, cuddle-up- in-bed indie folk of the Weepies and Kaiser Cartel. A Book Like This takes strength from its two young songwriters, both of whom approach love and coming-of-age issues from their own gendered perspective. Julia plays the part of the quirky ingénue, her vocals fluttering like a young Joanna Newsom over homespun melodies and gauzy instrumental backdrops... where brother Angus details an awkward encounter with the fairer sex". Leahey concluded "A Book Like This is an appropriate soundtrack for lazy Sunday afternoons and slow Monday mornings, when the pace of the world matches the relaxed gait of this band." ==Track listing== ===Alternative version (2009)=== ==Personnel== * Zach Brock– Strings, Violin * Ian Burdge– Cello * Mitchell Connelly– Drums, Percussion * Calina de la Mare– Violin * Emery Dobyns– Harmony * Ali Friend– Bass * Fran Healy– Bass, Congas, Glockenspiel, Piano * Sally Herbert– String Arrangements, Strings, Violin * Christopher Hoffman– Cello, Strings * John Metcalfe– Viola * Elizabeth Myers– Strings, Viola * Ian Pritchett– Bass * Jeff Ratner– Bass, Double Bass * Angus Stone– Guitar, Guitar (Electric), Harmonica, Vocals * Julia Stone– Bazouki, Guitar, Organ, Piano, Trumpet, Vocals * Cameron Whipp– Violin * Sarah Jane Wilson– Cello * Producers– Angus & Julia Stone, Fran Healy, Ian Pritchett * Mixer– Ian Pritchett * Album Illustrator– Caroline Pedler ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2007–2010) Peak position US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard) 32 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2007) Position Australian Artist Albums Chart 47 Chart (2008) Position Australian Albums Chart 60 Australian Artist Albums Chart 14 Chart (2010) Position Australian Artist Albums Chart 47 ==Certification== ==Release history== Country Date Format Label Catalogue Australia 8 September 2007 CD Capitol Records/EMI Music 5056592 Europe 8 September 2007 CD Discograph 3233062 United Kingdom 31 March 2008 CD/DVD, Digital download Flock/PIAS FLOCKCD1ST USA & Canada 2009 CD/DVD, Digital download Nettwerk 067003082525 ==References== Category:2007 albums Category:Angus & Julia Stone albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Independiente Records albums
